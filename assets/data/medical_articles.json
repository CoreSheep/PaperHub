            "chunk": "PURPOSE: Numerous uveitis articles were published in this century, underneath which hides valuable intelligence. We aimed to characterize the evolution and patterns in this field. METHODS: We divided the 15,994 uveitis papers into four consecutive time periods for bibliometric analysis, and applied latent Dirichlet allocation topic modeling and machine learning techniques to the latest period. . RESULTS: The yearly publication pattern fitted the curve: 1.21335x(2) - 4,848.95282x + 4,844,935.58876 (R(2) = 0.98311). The USA, the most productive country/region, focused on topics like ankylosing spondylitis and biologic therapy, whereas China (mainland) focused on topics like OCT and Behcet disease. The logistic regression showed the highest accuracy (71.6%) in the test set. CONCLUSION: In this century, a growing number of countries/regions/authors/journals are involved in the uveitis study, promoting the scientific output and thematic evolution. Our pioneering study uncovers the evolving academic trends and frontier patterns in this field using bibliometric analysis and AI algorithms.",

            "chunk": "Atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) are relatively common breast lesions on the same spectrum of disease. Atypical ductal hyperblasia is a nonmalignant, high-risk lesion, and DCIS is a noninvasive malignancy. While a benefit of screening mammography is early cancer detection, it also leads to increased biopsy diagnosis of noninvasive lesions. Previously, treatment guidelines for both entities included surgical excision because of the risk of upgrade to invasive cancer after surgery and risk of progression to invasive cancer for DCIS. However, this universal management approach is not optimal for all patients because most lesions are not upgraded after surgery. Furthermore, some DCIS lesions do not progress to clinically significant invasive cancer. Overtreatment of high-risk lesions and DCIS is considered a burden on patients and clinicians and is a strain on the health care system. Extensive research has identified many potential histologic, clinical, and imaging factors that may predict ADH and DCIS upgrade and thereby help clinicians select which patients should undergo surgery and which may be appropriate for active surveillance (AS) with imaging. Additionally, multiple clinical trials are currently underway to evaluate whether AS for DCIS is feasible for a select group of patients. Recent advances in MRI, artificial intelligence, and molecular markers may also have an important role to play in stratifying patients and delineating best management guidelines. This review article discusses the available evidence regarding the feasibility and limitations of AS for ADH and DCIS, as well as recent advances in patient risk stratification.",

METHODS: Following IRB approval, mammography audit reports, as specified in the BI-RADS atlas, were retrospectively generated for five radiologists reading at three locations during a 12-month time frame. One location had the AI tool (iCAD ProFound AI v2.0), and the other two locations did not. The co-primary endpoints were cancer detection rate (CDR) and abnormal interpretation rate (AIR). Secondary endpoints included positive predictive values (PPVs) for cancer among screenings with abnormal interpretations (PPV1) and for biopsies performed (PPV3). Odds ratios (OR) with two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) summarized the impact of AI across radiologists using generalized estimating equations. RESULTS: Nonsignificant differences were observed in CDR, AIR, and PPVs. The CDR was 7.3 with AI and 5.9 without AI (OR 1.3, 95% CI: 0.9-1.7). The AIR was 11.7% with AI and 11.8% without AI (OR 1.0, 95% CI: 0.8-1.3). The PPV1 was 6.2% with AI and 5.0% without AI (OR 1.3, 95% CI: 0.97-1.7). The PPV3 was 33.3% with AI and 32.0% without AI (OR 1.1, 95% CI: 0.8-1.5). CONCLUSION: Although we are unable to show statistically significant changes in CDR and AIR outcomes in the two groups, the results are consistent with prior reader studies. There is a nonsignificant trend toward improvement in CDR with AI, without significant increases in AIR.",

            "chunk": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of a new strategy for using artificial intelligence (AI) as supporting reader for the detection of breast cancer in mammography-based double reading screening practice. METHODS: Large-scale multi-site, multi-vendor data were used to retrospectively evaluate a new paradigm of AI-supported reading. Here, the AI served as the second reader only if it agrees with the recall/no-recall decision of the first human reader. Otherwise, a second human reader made an assessment followed by the standard clinical workflow. The data included 280 594 cases from 180 542 female participants screened for breast cancer at seven screening sites in two countries and using equipment from four hardware vendors. The statistical analysis included non-inferiority and superiority testing of cancer screening performance and evaluation of the reduction in workload, measured as arbitration rate and number of cases requiring second human reading. RESULTS: Artificial intelligence as a supporting reader was found to be superior or noninferior on all screening metrics compared with human double reading while reducing the number of cases requiring second human reading by up to 87% (245 395/280 594). Compared with AI as an independent reader, the number of cases referred to arbitration was reduced from 13% (35 199/280 594) to 2% (5056/280 594). CONCLUSION: The simulation indicates that the proposed workflow retains screening performance of human double reading while substantially reducing the workload. Further research should study the impact on the second human reader because they would only assess cases in which the AI prediction and first human reader disagree.",

            "chunk": "BACKGROUND: Aided by a collaborative partnership dating back to 2011, the Canadian Network for Public Health Intelligence (CNPHI) and the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program (CPSP) quickly undertook substantial enhancements to the CPSP's data collection instruments on the CNPHI platform to characterize the impacts of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on children and youth in Canada. Faced with an emerging public health threat with impacts yet unknown, the objective of the intervention was to rapidly complete enhancements to existing data collection and analytical tools to enable the CPSP's ability to characterize the impacts of COVID-19 in Canadian children and youth. INTERVENTION: Reporting frequency from CPSP's network of paediatric practitioners was increased from monthly to weekly, and the flexibility of detailed case data collection was substantially enhanced using complex survey instruments, interactively designed using CNPHI's Web Data technology. To ensure their data collection proceeded along all required lines of surveillance, CPSP's data collection tools were enhanced to collect demographic, epidemiological, microbiological and clinical data including comorbidities of cases identified. OUTCOMES: Less than a month after the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 pandemic, CPSP was able to start collecting detailed weekly case data on emerging cases of COVID-19 among Canadian children and youth. By May 2020, CPSP was able to launch a detailed study, supporting research into potential risk factors for severe COVID-19-related illness in children and youth. CONCLUSION: In response to a novel public health threat, CNPHI and CPSP were able to implement rapid adaptations and enhancements to existing data collection instruments while fortifying their preparedness to do the same in the future, when needed. With innovative and agile technologies at the ready, this experience helps to emphasize the importance of established collaborative partnerships across public health disciplines as a factor contributing to preparedness and agility to respond to the unforeseen. Canadian Network for Public Health Intelligence's Web Data technology showed agile adaptability and a capacity for complex and detailed data collection, supporting timely surveillance and response.",

Theoretically, the search is immediate, but many cases must wait 72 h to build an investigation folder as a legal criterion. This standard has been copied from the UK and Australian police reports without adapting to the Mexican context. The analysis of disappearance reports between 2006 and 2018 shows that this timing criterion in Mexico is not supported. The analyzed database (the National Center for Planning, Analysis, and Information to Combat Crime, CENAPI) showed that in the 72-h range, only 34.53% of the people had been found alive or dead; figure far from 50% to 80% of Europe or Australia. This fact shows that those searching officers or the judicial bureaucracy can act as a factor that limits the search for missing persons. Additionally, there is a random pattern in the geospatial distribution of disappearance, with non-homogeneous frequencies per year. Results highlight the participation of families, the adoption of an evidence-based model, and the generation of geospatial forensic intelligence analysis to generate evidence-based public policies. The social demand of families to the government for not considering them takes relevance in forensic practice in Mexico, and the disappearance data support this assertion.",

To assess this capability, we conducted a study comparing the performance of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 on the American Urological Association (AUA) 2022 self-assessment study program (SASP) exams from 2012-2023. METHODS: We used a standardized prompt to administer questions from the AUA SASP exams spanning 2012-2023, totalling 1679 questions. The performance of the two AI models, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, was evaluated based on the number of questions answered correctly. Statistical analysis was performed using Fisher's exact test and independent sample t-tests to compare the performance of GPT-4 to that of GPT-3.5 among test years and urology topic areas. Percentile scores were not calculable, however, a score of 50% is required to acquire CME credits on AUA SASP exams. RESULTS: The analysis showed significantly superior performance by GPT-4, which scored above 50% across all exam years except 2018, with scores ranging from 48-64%. In contrast, GPT-3.5 consistently scored below this threshold, with scores ranging from 26-38%. The total combined score for GPT-4 was 55%, significantly higher than the 33% achieved by GPT-3.5 (odds ratio [OR] 2.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.2-2.9, p<0.001). GPT-4 significantly outperformed GPT-3.5 among AUA SASP test years from 2012-2023 (mean difference 23, t(22) 14, 95% CI 19-26, p<0.001), as well as among urology topic areas (mean difference 21, t(52)=5.5, 95% CI 13-29, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: GPT-4 scored significantly higher than GPT-3.5 on the AUA SASP exams in overall performance, across all test years, and in various urology topic areas. This suggests improvement in evolving AI language models in answering clinical urology questions; however, certain aspects of medical knowledge and clinical reasoning remain challenging for AI language models.",

AI-powered psychotherapy tools present promising solutions for increasing accessibility to mental health care. However, the integration of AI in psychotherapy raises significant ethical concerns that require thorough consideration and regulation to ensure ethical practice, patient safety, and data privacy. This article discusses the ethical considerations surrounding the utilization of AI in psychotherapy, emphasizing the need for responsible implementation, patient privacy, and the human-AI interaction. The challenge raised by the use of artificial intelligence requires a comprehensive approach. Schools, in particular, are crucial in providing both knowledge and ethical guidance, helping young individuals decipher the complexities of online content. Additionally, parental support is essential, requiring the provision of time, fostering relationships, encouraging dialogue, and creating a safe environment to share experiences amidst the intricacies of adolescence. Reimagining social and healthcare services tailored for adolescents is equally crucial, taking into account recent societal changes. The integration of AI in psychotherapy has vast potential to transform mental healthcare. However, ensuring its accuracy and effectiveness demands a proactive approach to address associated ethical considerations. By adopting responsible practices, preserving patient autonomy, and continually refining AI systems, the field can leverage the benefits of AI in psychotherapy while maintaining high ethical standards.",

These technological advances threaten the data quality for studies that use online questionnaires. This study tested whether text generated by an AI for the purpose of an online study can be detected by both humans and automatic AI detection systems. While humans were able to correctly identify the authorship of such text above chance level (76% accuracy), their performance was still below what would be required to ensure satisfactory data quality. Researchers currently have to rely on a lack of interest among bad actors to successfully use open-ended responses as a useful tool for ensuring data quality. Automatic AI detection systems are currently completely unusable. If AI submissions of responses become too prevalent, then the costs associated with detecting fraudulent submissions will outweigh the benefits of online questionnaires. Individual attention checks will no longer be a sufficient tool to ensure good data quality. This problem can only be systematically addressed by crowdsourcing platforms. They cannot rely on automatic AI detection systems and it is unclear how they can ensure data quality for their paying clients.",

This work aims to facilitate this work by summarizing automated speech analytical concepts and the intersection of this field with psychosis research. We review psychosis continuum and sub-clinical psychotic experiences, and the benefits of researching them. Then, we discuss the connection between speech and psychotic symptoms. Thirdly, we overview current and state-of-the art approaches to the automated analysis of speech both in terms of language use (text-based analysis) and vocal features (audio-based analysis). Then, we review techniques applied in subclinical population and findings in these samples.

More recently, there has been a growing recognition that interventions involving artificial intelligence (AI) need to undergo rigorous, prospective evaluation to demonstrate their impact on health outcomes. The SPIRIT-AI (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials-Artificial Intelligence) extension is a new reporting guideline for clinical trial protocols evaluating interventions with an AI component. It was developed in parallel with its companion statement for trial reports: CONSORT-AI (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials-Artificial Intelligence). Both guidelines were developed through a staged consensus process involving literature review and expert consultation to generate 26 candidate items, which were consulted upon by an international multi-stakeholder group in a two-stage Delphi survey (103 stakeholders), agreed upon in a consensus meeting (31 stakeholders) and refined through a checklist pilot (34 participants). The SPIRIT-AI extension includes 15 new items that were considered sufficiently important for clinical trial protocols of AI interventions. These new items should be routinely reported in addition to the core SPIRIT 2013 items. SPIRIT-AI recommends that investigators provide clear descriptions of the AI intervention, including instructions and skills required for use, the setting in which the AI intervention will be integrated, considerations for the handling of input and output data, the human-AI interaction and analysis of error cases. SPIRIT-AI will help promote transparency and completeness for clinical trial protocols for AI interventions.

METHODS: From a database of 6,010 patients undergoing M3M surgery, 25 patients met the inclusion criteria of bilateral M3M removal with postoperative unilateral IAN injury. In this within-patient controlled trial, preoperative PANO and CBCT images were available, while 3D-AI models of the mandibular canal and teeth were generated from the CBCT images using the Virtual Patient Creator AI platform (Relu BV, Leuven, Belgium). Five examiners, who were blinded to surgical outcomes, assessed the imaging modalities and assigned scores indicating the risk level of IAN injury (high, medium, or low risk). Sensitivity, specificity, and area under receiver operating curve (AUC) for IAN risk assessment were calculated for each imaging modality. RESULTS: For IAN injury risk assessment after M3M removal, sensitivity was 0.87 for 3D-AI, 0.89 for CBCT versus 0.73 for PANO. Furthermore, the AUC and specificity values were 0.63 and 0.39 for 3D-AI, 0.58 and 0.28 for CBCT, and 0.57 and 0.41 for PANO, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference (p>0.05) among the imaging modalities for any diagnostic parameters. CONCLUSION: This within-patient controlled trial study revealed that risk assessment for IAN injury after M3M removal was rather similar for 3D-AI, PANO, and CBCT, with a sensitivity for injury prediction reaching up to 0.87 for 3D-AI and 0.89 for CBCT. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: This within-patient trial is pioneering in exploring the application of 3D AI-driven models for assessing IAN injury risk after M3M removal. The present results indicate that AI-powered 3D models based on CBCT might facilitate IAN risk assessment of M3M removal.",

            "chunk-id": 1,
            "chunk": "INTRODUCTION: A challenge when applying an artificial intelligence (AI) deep learning (DL) approach to novel electroencephalography (EEG) data, is the DL architecture's lack of adaptability to changing numbers of EEG channels. That is, the number of channels cannot vary neither in the training data, nor upon deployment. Such highly specific hardware constraints put major limitations on the clinical usability and scalability of the DL models. METHODS: In this work, we propose a technique for handling such varied numbers of EEG channels by splitting the EEG montages into distinct regions and merge the channels within the same region to a region representation. The solution is termed Region Based Pooling (RBP). The procedure of splitting the montage into regions is performed repeatedly with different region configurations, to minimize potential loss of information. As RBP maps a varied number of EEG channels to a fixed number of region representations, both current and future DL architectures may apply RBP with ease. To demonstrate and evaluate the adequacy of RBP to handle a varied number of EEG channels, sex classification based solely on EEG was used as a test example. The DL models were trained on 129 channels, and tested on 32, 65, and 129-channels versions of the data using the same channel positions scheme. The baselines for comparison were zero-filling the missing channels and applying spherical spline interpolation. The performances were estimated using 5-fold cross validation. RESULTS: For the 32-channel system version, the mean AUC values across the folds were: RBP (93.34%), spherical spline interpolation (93.36%), and zero-filling (76.82%). Similarly, on the 65-channel system version, the performances were: RBP (93.66%), spherical spline interpolation (93.50%), and zero-filling (85.58%). Finally, the 129-channel system version produced the following results: RBP (94.68%), spherical spline interpolation (93.86%), and zero-filling (91.92%). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, RBP obtained similar results to spherical spline interpolation, and superior results to zero-filling. We encourage further research and development of DL models in the cross-dataset setting, including the use of methods such as RBP and spherical spline interpolation to handle a varied number of EEG channels.",

However, little is known about the application of AI in treatment decisions for patients with polytrauma. In this systematic review, we investigated the benefits and performance of AI in predicting the management of patients with polytrauma and trauma.&lt;/br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Methods:&lt;/b&gt; This systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Studies were extracted from the PubMed and Google Scholar databases from their inception until November 2022, using the search terms \"Artificial intelligence,\" \"polytrauma,\" and \"decision.\" Seventeen articles were identified and screened for eligibility. Animal studies, review articles, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and studies that did not involve polytrauma or severe trauma management decisions were excluded. Eight studies were eligible for final review.&lt;/br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; Eight studies focusing on patients with trauma, including two on military trauma, were included. The AI applications were mainly implemented for predictions and/or decisions on shock, bleeding, and blood transfusion. Few studies predicted death/survival. The identification of trauma patients using AI was proposed in a previous study. The overall performance of AI was good (six studies), excellent (one study), and acceptable (one study).&lt;/br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Discussion:&lt;/b&gt; AI demonstrated satisfactory performance in decision-making and management prediction in patients with polytrauma/severe trauma, especially in situations of shock/bleeding.&lt;/br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Importance:&lt;/b&gt; The present study serves as a basis for further research to develop practical AI applications for the management of patients with trauma.&lt;/br&gt.",

This study presents a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for automated COVID-19 RATD image classification. METHODS: To address the absence of a RATD image dataset, we crowdsourced 900 real-world images focusing on positive and negative cases. Rigorous data augmentation and StyleGAN2-ADA generated simulated images to overcome dataset limitations and class imbalances. RESULTS: The best CNN model achieved a 93% validation accuracy. Test accuracies were 88% for simulated datasets and 82% for real datasets. Augmenting simulated images during training did not significantly improve real-world test image performance but enhanced simulated test image performance. DISCUSSION: The findings of this study highlight the potential of the developed model in expediting COVID-19 testing processes and facilitating large-scale testing and tracking systems. The study also underscores the challenges in designing and developing such models, emphasizing the importance of addressing dataset limitations and class imbalances. CONCLUSION: This research contributes to the deployment of large-scale testing and tracking systems, offering insights into the potential applications of AI in mitigating outbreaks similar to COVID-19. Future work could focus on refining the model and exploring its adaptability to other healthcare scenarios.",

This paper explores full-spectrum applications of AGI across radiation oncology including initial consultation, simulation, treatment planning, treatment delivery, treatment verification, and patient follow-up. The fusion of vision data with LLMs also creates powerful multimodal models that elucidate nuanced clinical patterns. Together, AGI promises to catalyze a shift towards data-driven, personalized radiation therapy. However, these models should complement human expertise and care. This paper provides an overview of how AGI can transform radiation oncology to elevate the standard of patient care in radiation oncology, with the key insight being AGI's ability to exploit multimodal clinical data at scale.",

The aim of this study determining the relationship between spiritual intelligence and intolerance of uncertainty, anxiety, and fear of corona in the elderly. METHODOLOGY: A cross-sectional study was done on 207 elderly people who referred to comprehensive health service centers in Mashhad in 2022. The samples were selected based on the inclusion criteria using multistage and cluster sampling. To collect data, various questionnaires were used, including demographic characteristics (age, gender, marital status ...), King's Spiritual Intelligence Questionnaire, Freestone's Intolerance of Uncertainty Questionnaire, Corona Anxiety Scale, and Coronavirus Fear Scale. Statistical analysis of variables was done using descriptive and analytical (independent t-test, Mann-Whitney, analysis of variance, linear regression) tests by means of STATA version 14. RESULTS: The average level of spiritual intelligence was 54.1. Participants reported a high level of intolerance of uncertainty (M = 79.2) and fear of corona (M = 14.09). Education, economic status, and marital status were the predictors of spiritual intelligence of the studied subjects (r = 0.24, P < .05). Spiritual intelligence and gender were also related to uncertainty intolerance (r = 0.12, P < .05). Another finding of the study was the superiority of variables of spiritual intelligence and gender in predicting the level of anxiety of corona compared to other variables (r = 0.17, P < .05). CONCLUSION: There was a relationship between spiritual intelligence, education, and gender with the level of fear and anxiety of corona. Therefore, planning and implementing educational projects based on increasing spiritual intelligence for the elderly with priority for elderly women and with a low level of literacy and income is recommended.",

Interpretation conflict is another source of potential conflict that can cause serious concern for process safety as it is often perceived as confusion, surprise, or a mistake. It is intangible and associated with situation awareness. However, interpretation conflict has not been studied with the required emphasis. The current work proposes a novel methodology to quantify interpretation conflict probability and risk. The methodology is demonstrated, tested, and validated on a two-phase separator. The results show that interpretation conflict is usually hidden, mixed, or covered by traditional faults, and noises in observation and interpretation, including sensor faults, logic errors, cyberattacks, human mistakes, and misunderstandings, may easily trigger interpretation conflict. The proposed methodology will serve as a mechanism to develop strategies to manage interpretation conflict.",

These technological advancements are generating significant interest among HR leaders to embrace AI in human resource management (HRM). Researchers and practitioners are keen to investigate the adoption of AI in HRM and the resultant human-machine collaboration. This study investigates HRM specific factors that enable and inhibit the adoption of AI in extended HR ecosystems and adopts a qualitative case research design with an abductive approach. It studies three well-known Indian companies at different stages of AI adoption in HR functions. This research investigates key enablers such as optimistic and collaborative employees, strong digital leadership, reliable HR data, specialized HR partners, and well-rounded AI ethics. The study also examines barriers to adoption: the inability to have a timely pulse check of employees' emotions, ineffective collaboration of HR employees with digital experts as well as external HR partners, and not embracing AI ethics. This study contributes to the theory by providing a model for AI adoption and proposes additions to the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology in the context of AI adoption in HR ecosystems. The study also contributes to the best-in-class industry HR practices and digital policy formulation to reimagine workplaces, promote harmonious human-AI collaboration, and make workplaces future-ready in the wake of massive digital disruptions.",

Integrating passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) with an automated sound identifier, a long-term biodiversity monitoring project containing six PAM stations, was launched in YSNP in January 2020 and is currently ongoing. SILIC, an automated wildlife sound identification model, was used to extract sounds and species information from the recordings collected. Animal vocal activity can reflect their breeding status, behaviour, population, movement and distribution, which may be affected by factors, such as habitat loss, climate change and human activity. This massive amount of wildlife vocalisation dataset can provide essential information for the National Park's headquarters on resource management and decision-making. It can also be valuable for those studying the effects of climate change on animal distribution and behaviour at a regional or global scale. NEW INFORMATION: To our best knowledge, this is the first open-access dataset with species occurrence data extracted from sounds in soundscape recordings by artificial intelligence. We obtained seven bird species for the first release, with more bird species and other taxa, such as mammals and frogs, to be updated annually. Raw recordings containing over 1.7 million one-minute recordings collected between the years 2020 and 2021 were analysed and SILIC identified 6,243,820 vocalisations of seven bird species in 439,275 recordings. The automatic detection had a precision of 0.95 and the recall ranged from 0.48 to 0.80. In terms of the balance between precision and recall, we prioritised increasing precision over recall in order to minimise false positive detections. In this dataset, we summarised the count of vocalisations detected per sound class per recording which resulted in 802,670 occurrence records. Unlike data from traditional human observation methods, the number of observations in the Darwin Core \"organismQuantity\" column refers to the number of vocalisations detected for a specific bird species and cannot be directly linked to the number of individuals.We expect our dataset will be able to help fill the data gaps of fine-scale avian temporal activity patterns in montane forests and contribute to studies concerning the impacts of climate change on montane forest ecosystems on regional or global scales.",

            "chunk": "BACKGROUND: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies such as Generative AI (GenAI) have become more common in academic settings, it is necessary to examine how these tools interact with issues of authorship, academic integrity, and research methodologies. The current landscape lacks cohesive policies and guidelines for regulating AI's role in academic research which has prompted discussions among publishers, authors, and institutions. METHODS: This study employs inductive thematic analysis to explore publisher policies regarding AI-assisted authorship and academic work. Our methods involved a two-fold analysis using both AI-assisted and traditional unassisted techniques to examine the available policies from leading academic publishers and other publishing or academic entities. The framework was designed to offer multiple perspectives, harnessing the strengths of AI for pattern recognition while leveraging human expertise for nuanced interpretation. The results of these two analyses are combined to form the final themes. RESULTS: Our findings indicate six overall themes, three of which were independently identified in both the AI-assisted and unassisted, manual analysis using common software tools. A broad consensus appears among publishers that human authorship remains paramount and that the use of GenAI tools is permissible but must be disclosed. However, GenAI tools are increasingly acknowledged for their supportive roles, including text generation and data analysis. The study also discusses the inherent limitations and biases of AI-assisted analysis, necessitating rigorous scrutiny by authors, reviewers, and editors. CONCLUSIONS: There is a growing recognition of AI's role as a valuable auxiliary tool in academic research, but one that comes with caveats pertaining to integrity, accountability, and interpretive limitations. This study used a novel analysis supported by GenAI tools to identify themes emerging in the policy landscape, underscoring the need for an informed, flexible approach to policy formulation that can adapt to the rapidly evolving landscape of AI technologies.",

This study aimed at assessing the knowledge and perception of healthcare professionals in Nigeria regarding the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning in the health sector. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was undertaken amongst healthcare professionals in Nigeria with the use of a questionnaire. Data were collected across the six geopolitical zones in the Country using a stratified multistage sampling method. Descriptive and inferential statistical analyses were undertaken for the data obtained. RESULTS: Female participants (55.7%) were slightly higher in proportion compared to the male respondents (44.3%). Pharmacists accounted for 27.7% of the participants, and this was closely followed by medical doctors (24.5%) and nurses (19.3%). The majority of the respondents (57.2%) reported good knowledge regarding artificial intelligence and machine learning, about a third of the participants (32.2%) were of average knowledge, and 10.6% of the sample had poor knowledge. More than half of the respondents (57.8%) disagreed with the notion that the adoption of artificial intelligence in the Nigerian healthcare sector could result in job losses. Two-thirds of the participants (66.7%) were of the view that the integration of artificial intelligence in healthcare will augment human intelligence. Three-quarters (77%) of the respondents agreed that the use of machine learning in Nigerian healthcare could facilitate efficient service delivery. CONCLUSION: This study provides novel insights regarding healthcare professionals' knowledge and perception with respect to the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning in healthcare. The emergent findings from this study can guide government and policymakers in decision-making as regards deployment of artificial intelligence and machine learning for healthcare delivery.",

            "chunk": "INTRODUCTION: It has become de rigueur for healthcare systems to tout their ability to provide compassionate medical care that addresses the emotional as well as physical needs of patients. Not surprisingly, then, there is considerable pressure on medical schools to train their students to be empathic. Existing literature on empathy training in medicine tends to focus on how to build emotional intelligence in individual trainees, largely ignoring the sociocultural factors that contribute to or thwart empathy development in medical school. Additionally, research tends to examine student perspectives, with little attention given to medical educators and their viewpoints. METHODS: In this paper, we adopt an \"emotion practice\" framework and utilize an inductive descriptive study design to qualitatively consider how first year medical students (N = 23) and their instructors (N = 9) perceive empathy training at a site we call Midtown Medical School. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: We find that both groups have an understanding of empathic capital but differ in their beliefs about the utility and legitimacy of this capital. Both educators and students also recognize the limitations of standardized empathy curriculum but do not agree on the implications of such rote learning. Finally, students and instructors alike find the hidden curriculum of medical school to be antithetical to empathy development, concurring that it is difficult to cultivate empathy in spaces where biomedical coursework is prioritized over social-emotional learning. In short, both groups find it difficult to be kind in an unkind place.",

Since the dose prediction involve both linear and nonlinear problems, traditional machine learning algorithms are ineffective to solve such problems at one time. OBJECTIVE: Based on the characteristics of clinical data of Chinese warfarin patients, an improved stacking ensemble learning can achieve higher prediction accuracy. METHODS: Information of 641 patients from southern China who had reached a steady state on warfarin was collected, including demographic information, medical history, genotype, and co-medication status. The dataset was randomly divided into a training set (90%) and a test set (10%). The predictive capability is evaluated on a new test set generated by stacking ensemble learning. Additional factors associated with warfarin dose were discovered by feature selection methods. RESULTS: A newly proposed heuristic-stacking ensemble learning performs better than traditional-stacking ensemble learning in key metrics such as accuracy of ideal dose (73.44%, 71.88%), mean absolute errors (0.11 mg/day, 0.13 mg/day), root mean square errors (0.18 mg/day, 0.20 mg/day) and R(2) (0.87, 0.82). CONCLUSIONS: The developed heuristic-stacking ensemble learning can satisfactorily predict warfarin dose with high accuracy. A relationship between hypertension, a history of severe preoperative embolism, and warfarin dose is found, which provides a useful reference for the warfarin dose administration in the future.",

The increase in potential AI applications has led to discussions regarding responsible AI and explainable AI (XAI). Current discussions of RAI, however, are limited in their consideration of the patient as an active participant with AI. Therefore, we propose a patient-centered, rather than a patient-adjacent, approach to RAI and XAI, that identifies autonomy, beneficence, justice, trust, privacy, and transparency as core concepts to uphold for health professionals and patients. We present empirical evidence that these principles are strongly valued by patients. We further suggest possible design solutions that uphold these principles and acknowledge the pressing need for further research about practical applications to uphold these principles.",

            "chunk": "INTRODUCTION: In a drip-and-ship model for endovascular thrombectomy (EVT), early identification of large vessel occlusion (LVO) and timely referral to a comprehensive center (CSC) are crucial when patients are admitted to an acute stroke center (ASC). Several artificial intelligence (AI) decision-aid tools are increasingly being used to facilitate the rapid identification of LVO. This retrospective cohort study aimed to evaluate the impact of deploying e-Stroke AI decision support software in the hyperacute stroke pathway on process metrics and patient outcomes at an ASC in the United Kingdom. METHODS: Except for the deployment of e-Stroke on 01 March 2020, there were no significant changes made to the stroke pathway at the ASC. The data were obtained from a prospective stroke registry between 01 January 2019 and 31 March 2021. The outcomes were compared between the 14 months before and 12 months after the deployment of AI (pre-e-Stroke cohort vs. post-e-Stroke cohort) on 01 March 2020. Time window analyses were performed using Welch's t-test. Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test was used to compare changes in disability at 3 months assessed by modified Rankin Score (mRS) ordinal shift analysis, and Fisher's exact test was used for dichotomised mRS analysis. RESULTS: In the pre-e-Stroke cohort, 19 of 22 patients referred received EVT. In the post-e-Stroke cohort, 21 of the 25 patients referred were treated. The mean door-in-door-out (DIDO) and door-to-referral times in pre-e-Stroke vs. post-e-Stroke cohorts were 141 vs. 79 min (difference 62 min, 95% CI 96.9-26.8 min, p < 0.001) and 71 vs. 44 min (difference 27 min, 95% CI 47.4-5.4 min, p = 0.01), respectively. The adjusted odds ratio (age and NIHSS) for mRS ordinal shift analysis at 3 months was 3.14 (95% CI 0.99-10.51, p = 0.06) and the dichotomized mRS 0-2 at 3 months was 16% vs. 48% (p = 0.04) in the pre- vs. post-e-Stroke cohorts, respectively. CONCLUSION: In this single-center study in the United Kingdom, the DIDO time significantly decreased since the introduction of e-Stroke decision support software into an ASC hyperacute stroke pathway. The reduction in door-in to referral time indicates faster image interpretation and referral for EVT. There was an indication of an increased proportion of patients regaining independent function after EVT. However, this should be interpreted with caution given the small sample size. Larger, prospective studies and further systematic real-world evaluation are needed to demonstrate the widespread generalisability of these findings.",

            "chunk-id": 1,
            "chunk": "BACKGROUND: Emotional intelligence is the self-perception related to identification and regulation of emotions. Several studies have been done among Indian teachers evaluating emotional intelligence in relation to demographic, professional and various psychological parameters, but the variety of scales, teacher types, and conflicting results makes it difficult to draw any meaningful conclusions from this heterogeneous data.The present work aims to synthesize the available data by both qualitative and quantitative analysis and is the first such attempt to include only Indian studies in this field. The main objectives were to determine the correlation of emotional intelligence with teachers' health parameters and to study the gender difference in emotional intelligence. METHODS: After a thorough literature search in Google, Google scholar, Scopus, Web of science and Pubmed, fifty-five Indian studies were selected which empirically examined teachers' emotional intelligence, either alone or in association with another parameter evaluating teachers' psychological health and performance. After qualitative assessment of major findings, quantitative analysis was performed. Three separate meta-analysis were carried out. The first one with fifteen effect sizes among 3291 participants evaluated correlation with personal health parameters. The second with nineteen effect sizes in 4165 participants evaluated correlation with professional health parameters. The third with twenty-six studies involving 6005 participants assessed effect of gender. RESULTS: The results show that almost all studies have used a trait measure, teachers' emotional intelligence is positively correlated with both personal and professional health parameters and gender has no effect on emotional intelligence. CONCLUSION: Major limitations are a very high degree of heterogeneity of the data, incomplete description of the scales, inadequate randomization and small sample sizes in many studies. The results indicate the importance of emotional intelligence in both personal and professional life of teachers and no effect of gender preparing a solid base for future research.",

Generative models could discern elusive patterns within the vast sequence space and uncover new functional enzyme sequences. This review highlights the recent advancements in employing generative AI for enzyme sequence analysis. We delve into the impact of generative AI in predicting mutation effects on enzyme fitness, catalytic activity and stability, rationalizing the laboratory evolution of de novo enzymes, and decoding protein sequence semantics and their application in enzyme engineering. Notably, the prediction of catalytic activity and stability of enzymes using natural protein sequences serves as a vital link, indicating how enzyme catalysis shapes enzyme evolution. Overall, we foresee that the integration of generative AI into enzyme studies will remarkably enhance our knowledge of enzymes and expedite the creation of superior biocatalysts.",

Studies have found that these snake venom proteins have the potential to treat cardiovascular and nervous system diseases. Therefore, the study of snake venom protein is conducive to the development of related drugs. The research technologies based on traditional biochemistry can accurately identify these proteins, but the experimental cost is high and the time is long. Artificial intelligence technology provides a new means and strategy for large-scale screening of snake venom proteins from the perspective of computing. In this paper, we developed a sequence-based computational method to recognize snake toxin proteins. Specially, we utilized three different feature descriptors, namely g-gap, natural vector and word 2 vector, to encode snake toxin protein sequences. The analysis of variance (ANOVA), gradient-boost decision tree algorithm (GBDT) combined with incremental feature selection (IFS) were used to optimize the features, and then the optimized features were input into the deep learning model for model training. The results show that our model can achieve a prediction performance with an accuracy of 82.00% in 10-fold cross-validation. The model is further verified on independent data, and the accuracy rate reaches to 81.14%, which demonstrated that our model has excellent prediction performance and robustness.",

            "chunk": "The field of histopathological image analysis has evolved significantly with the advent of digital pathology, leading to the development of automated models capable of classifying tissues and structures within diverse pathological images. Artificial intelligence algorithms, such as convolutional neural networks, have shown remarkable capabilities in pathology image analysis tasks, including tumor identification, metastasis detection, and patient prognosis assessment. However, traditional manual analysis methods have generally shown low accuracy in diagnosing colorectal cancer using histopathological images. This study investigates the use of AI in image classification and image analytics using histopathological images using the histogram of oriented gradients method. The study develops an AI-based architecture for image classification using histopathological images, aiming to achieve high performance with less complexity through specific parameters and layers. In this study, we investigate the complicated state of histopathological image classification, explicitly focusing on categorizing nine distinct tissue types. Our research used open-source multi-centered image datasets that included records of 100.000 non-overlapping images from 86 patients for training and 7180 non-overlapping images from 50 patients for testing. The study compares two distinct approaches, training artificial intelligence-based algorithms and manual machine learning models, to automate tissue classification. This research comprises two primary classification tasks: binary classification, distinguishing between normal and tumor tissues, and multi-classification, encompassing nine tissue types, including adipose, background, debris, stroma, lymphocytes, mucus, smooth muscle, normal colon mucosa, and tumor. Our findings show that artificial intelligence-based systems can achieve 0.91 and 0.97 accuracy in binary and multi-class classifications. In comparison, the histogram of directed gradient features and the Random Forest classifier achieved accuracy rates of 0.75 and 0.44 in binary and multi-class classifications, respectively. Our artificial intelligence-based methods are generalizable, allowing them to be integrated into histopathology diagnostics procedures and improve diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. The CNN model outperforms existing machine learning techniques, demonstrating its potential to improve the precision and effectiveness of histopathology image analysis. This research emphasizes the importance of maintaining data consistency and applying normalization methods during the data preparation stage for analysis. It particularly highlights the potential of artificial intelligence to assess histopathological images.",

Some high-risk HPV types play a crucial role in the progression of cervical cancer and precancerous lesions. Therefore, HPV screening has become an important means to prevent, diagnose, and triage cervical cancer. This study aims to leverage artificial intelligence to predict individual risks of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) in women with high-risk HPV infection and to recommend the appropriate triage strategy and follow-up period according to the risk level. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 475 cases were collected in this study. The sources were from the Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics in a tertiary hospital, a case report on HPV from the PubMed website, and clinical data of cervical cancer patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Through in-depth study of the interaction between high-risk HPV and its risk factors, the risk factor relationship diagram structure was constructed. A Classification of Lesion Stages (CLS) algorithm was designed to predict cervical lesion stages. The risk levels of patients were analyzed based on all risk factors, and follow-up periods were formulated for each risk level. RESULTS: Our proposed CLS algorithm predicted the probability of occurrence of CIN3-the precancerous lesion stage of cervical cancer. This prediction was based on patients' HPV-16 and -18 infection status, age, presence of persistent infection, and HPV type. Follow-up periods of 3-6 months, 6-12 months, and 3- to 5-year intervals were suggested for high-risk, medium-risk, and low-risk patients, respectively. CONCLUSION: A lesion prediction model was constructed to determine the probabilities of occurrence of CIN by analyzing individual data, such as patient lifestyle, physical assessments, and patient complaints, in order to identify high-risk patients. Furthermore, the potential implications of the calculated features were mined to devise prevention strategies.",

These were defining valuable scenarios to simulate and the availability of appropriate data. This paper posits that drawing on the research on the \"everyday\" digital health perspective in designing ABSS before or during health crises, can overcome aspects of these challenges. The focus on digital health interventions reflects a rapid shift in the adoption of such technologies during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, and the new challenges this poses for policy makers.

Multiple studies have evaluated the performance of convolutional neural networks, and most algorithms match or even surpass the accuracy of dermatologists. However, only 23.8% of dermatologists have good or excellent knowledge of the topic. We believe that the lack of knowledge physicians experience regarding artificial intelligence is an obstacle to its clinical implementation. We describe how a convolutional neural network differentiates a benign from a malignant lesion. We systematically searched the Web of Science, Medline (PubMed), and The Cochrane Library on the 9th February, 2022. We focused on articles describing the role and use of artificial intelligence in melanoma recognition between 2017 and 2022, using the following MeSH terms: \"melanoma,\" \"diagnosis,\" and \"artificial intelligence\". Traditional machine learning algorithms comprise different parts which must preprocess, segment, extract features and classify the lesion into benign or malignant. Deep learning algorithms can perform these steps simultaneously, which significantly enhances efficiency. Convolutional neural networks include a convolutional layer, a pooling layer, and a fully connected layer. Convolutional and pooling layers extract features from the lesion and reduce computational power, whereas fully connected layers classify the image into two or more categories. Additionally, we suggest that further studies should be performed to accelerate the clinical implementation of artificial intelligence, to create comprehensive datasets and to generate explainable algorithms.",

At the intersection of both paradigms, a novel approach referred to as \"simulation intelligence\", has emerged as a powerful tool for comprehending and controlling complex systems, including plants and crops. This work explores the transformative potential for the plant science community of the nine simulation intelligence motifs, from understanding molecular plant processes to optimizing greenhouse control. Many of these concepts, such as surrogate models and agent-based modeling, have gained prominence in plant and crop sciences. In contrast, some motifs, such as open-ended optimization or program synthesis, still need to be explored further. The motifs of simulation intelligence can potentially revolutionize breeding and precision farming towards more sustainable food production.",

Inconsistent color reproduction by WSI scanners of different models and from different manufacturers can result in different color representations and inter-scanner color variation in the WSIs. Although pathologists can accommodate a range of color variation during their evaluation of WSIs, color variability can degrade the performance of computational applications in digital pathology. In particular, color variability can compromise the generalization of artificial intelligence applications to large volumes of data from diverse sources. To address these challenges, we developed a process that includes two modules: (1) assessing the color reproducibility of our scanners and the color variation among them and (2) applying color correction to WSIs to minimize the color deviation and variation. Our process ensures consistent color reproduction across WSI scanners and enhances color homogeneity in WSIs, and its flexibility enables easy integration as a post-processing step following scanning by WSI scanners of different models and from different manufacturers.",

In the age of AI, the role of HRM professionals in organizations continues to evolve. Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming many HRM functions and practices throughout organizations creating system and process efficiencies, performing advanced data analysis, and contributing to the value creation process of the organization. A growing body of evidence highlights the benefits AI brings to the field of HRM. Despite the increased interest in AI-HRM scholarship, focus on human-AI interaction at work and AI-based technologies for HRM is limited and fragmented. Moreover, the lack of human considerations in HRM tech design and deployment can hamper AI digital transformation efforts. This paper provides a contemporary and forward-looking perspective to the strategic and human-centric role HRM plays within organizations as AI becomes more integrated in the workplace. Spanning three distinct phases of AI-HRM integration (technocratic, integrated, and fully-embedded), it examines the technical, human, and ethical challenges at each phase and provides suggestions on how to overcome them using a human-centric approach. Our paper highlights the importance of the evolving role of HRM in the AI-driven organization and provides a roadmap on how to bring humans and machines closer together in the workplace.",

In healthcare, AI enhances efficiency, streamlines processes, and supports decision-making. However, challenges include potential errors and biases in algorithms, data privacy concerns, legal and ethical issues, and resistance to change. In nursing, a delicate balance emerges between AI and human touch. While AI aids in data-driven decision-making and administrative tasks, it lacks the emotional intelligence, empathy, and nuanced understanding crucial to nursing care. Nurses excel in critical thinking, adaptability to dynamic situations, patient advocacy, collaboration, and establishing human connections. AI supports these functions by automating routine tasks and offering decision support tools, yet its rigidity in dynamic situations and lack of human touch pose limitations. This review underscores the necessity of careful AI integration in healthcare, acknowledging its advantages while mitigating drawbacks. In nursing, the symbiosis between AI and human qualities is vital. The role of AI should be to complement, not replace, the unique skills and empathetic aspects of nursing care. Addressing concerns related to bias, transparency, data privacy, and professional training is essential for maximizing the benefits of AI in healthcare while preserving the human touch in patient care.

This research aims to employ deep learning (DL) through convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to distinguish between normal lymph nodes and 3 WHO common subtypes of canine lymphomas. To train and validate the CNN, 1,530 high-resolution microscopic images derived from whole slide scans (WSIs) were used, including those of background areas, hyperplastic lymph nodes (n = 4), and three different lymphoma subtypes: diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL; n = 5), lymphoblastic (LBL; n = 5), and marginal zone lymphoma (MZL; n = 3). The CNN was able to correctly identify 456 images of the possible 457 test sets, achieving a maximum accuracy of 99.34%. The results of this study have demonstrated the feasibility of using deep learning to differentiate between hyperplastic lymph nodes and lymphomas, as well as to classify common WHO subtypes.

Participants of the workshop on \"Artificial Intelligence in Biology and Medicine\" (Jerusalem, Feb 14-15, 2023), both researchers and practitioners, aimed to build a holistic picture by exploring AI advancements, challenges and perspectives, as well as to suggest new fields for AI applications. Presentations showcased the potential of large language models (LLMs) in generating molecular structures, predicting protein-ligand interactions, and promoting democratization of AI development. Ethical concerns in medical decision making were also addressed. In biological applications, AI integration of multi-omics and clinical data elucidated the health relevant effects of low doses of ionizing radiation. Bayesian latent modeling identified statistical associations between unobserved variables. Medical applications highlighted liquid biopsy methods for non-invasive diagnostics, routine laboratory tests to identify overlooked illnesses, and AI's role in oral and maxillofacial imaging. Explainable AI and diverse image processing tools improved diagnostics, while text classification detected anorexic behavior in blog posts. The workshop fostered knowledge sharing, discussions, and emphasized the need for further AI development in radioprotection research in support of emerging public health issues. The organizers plan to continue the initiative as an annual event, promoting collaboration and addressing issues and perspectives in AI applications with a focus on low-dose radioprotection research. Researchers involved in radioprotection research and experts in relevant public policy domains are invited to explore the utility of AI in low-dose radiation research at the next workshop.",

However, visual assessment, the current standard method used to identify rosacea, is often subjective among clinicians and results in high variation. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have allowed for the effective detection of various skin diseases with high accuracy and consistency. In this study, we develop a new methodology, coined \"five accurate CNNs-based evaluation system (FACES)\", to identify and classify rosacea more efficiently. First, 19 CNN-based models that have been widely used for image classification were trained and tested via training and validation data sets. Next, the five best performing models were selected based on accuracy, which served as a weight value for FACES. At the same time, we also applied a majority rule to five selected models to detect rosacea. The results exhibited that the performance of FACES was superior to that of the five individual CNN-based models and the majority rule in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision. In particular, the accuracy and sensitivity of FACES were the highest, and the specificity and precision were higher than most of the individual models. To improve the performance of our system, future studies must consider patient details, such as age, gender, and race, and perform comparison tests between our model system and clinicians.",

            "chunk": "Human death is a complex, time-governed phenomenon that leads to the irreversible cessation of all bodily functions. Recent molecular and genetic studies have revealed remarkable experimental evidence of genetically programmed cellular death characterized by several physiological processes; however, the basic physiological function that occurs during the immediate postmortem period remains inadequately described. There is a paucity of knowledge connecting necrotic pathologies occurring in human organ tissues to complete functional loss of the human organism. Cells, tissues, organs, and organ systems show a range of differential resilience and endurance responses that occur during organismal death. Intriguingly, a persistent ambiguity in the study of postmortem physiological systems is the determination of the trajectory of a complex multicellular human body, far from life-sustaining homeostasis, following the gradual or sudden expiry of its regulatory systems. Recent groundbreaking investigations have resulted in a paradigm shift in understanding the cell biology and physiology of death. Two significant findings are that (i) most cells in the human body are microbial, and (ii) microbial cell abundance significantly increases after death. By addressing the physiological as well as the microbiological aspects of death, future investigations are poised to reveal innovative insights into the enigmatic biological activities associated with death and human decomposition. Understanding the elaborate crosstalk of abiotic and biotic factors in the context of death has implications for scientific discoveries important to informing translational knowledge regarding the transition from living to the non-living. There are important and practical needs for a transformative reestablishment of accepted models of biological death (i.e., artificial intelligence, AI) for more precise determinations of when the regulatory mechanisms for homeostasis of a living individual have ceased. In this review, we summarize mechanisms of physiological, genetic, and microbiological processes that define the biological changes and pathways associated with human organismal death and decomposition.",

The objective includes visualizing the model's process for interpretability and comparing its diagnostic precision with a cohort of 80 radiologists. We employed ResNet as the classification backbone for thyroid nodule prediction. The model was trained using 2096 ultrasound images of 655 distinct thyroid nodules. For performance evaluation, an independent test set comprising 100 cases of thyroid nodules was curated. In addition, to demonstrate the superiority of the artificial intelligence (AI) model over radiologists, a Turing test was conducted with 80 radiologists of varying clinical experience. This was meant to assess which group of radiologists' conclusions were in closer alignment with AI predictions. Furthermore, to highlight the interpretability of the AI model, gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) was employed to visualize the model's areas of focus during its prediction process. In this cohort, AI diagnostics demonstrated a sensitivity of 81.67%, a specificity of 60%, and an overall diagnostic accuracy of 73%. In comparison, the panel of radiologists on average exhibited a diagnostic accuracy of 62.9%. The AI's diagnostic process was significantly faster than that of the radiologists. The generated heat-maps highlighted the model's focus on areas characterized by calcification, solid echo and higher echo intensity, suggesting these areas might be indicative of malignant thyroid nodules. Our study supports the notion that deep learning can be a valuable diagnostic tool with comparable accuracy to experienced senior radiologists in the diagnosis of malignant thyroid nodules. The interpretability of the AI model's process suggests that it could be clinically meaningful. Further studies are necessary to improve diagnostic accuracy and support auxiliary diagnoses in primary care settings.",

Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR) is a technology that can be used to analyze biological samples in a non-invasive manner. This study evaluated the use of NIR spectroscopy in the fingertip to detect neutropenia in solid-tumor oncologic patients. A total of 75 patients were enrolled in the study. Fingertip NIR spectra and complete blood counts were collected from each patient. The NIR spectra were pre-processed using Savitzky-Golay smoothing and outlier detection. The pre-processed data were split into training/validation and test sets using the Kennard-Stone method. A toolbox of supervised machine learning classification algorithms was applied to the training/validation set using a stratified 5-fold cross-validation regimen. The algorithms included linear discriminant analysis (LDA), logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and support vector machines (SVMs). The SVM model performed best in the validation step, with 85% sensitivity, 89% negative predictive value (NPV), and 64% accuracy. The SVM model showed 67% sensitivity, 82% NPV, and 57% accuracy on the test set. These results suggest that NIR spectroscopy in the fingertip, combined with machine learning methods, can be used to detect neutropenia in solid-tumor oncology patients in a non-invasive and timely manner. This approach could help reduce exposure to invasive tests and prevent neutropenic patients from inadvertently undergoing chemotherapy.",

Recent advancements have been made to identify and characterize circulating cancer-specific mutations in cell-free circulating DNA derived from tumors and tumor cells. A patient's delay between the time they first detect symptoms and the time they contact a doctor has been noted for many cancer forms. The tumor's location and features significantly impact the presentation of symptoms judged appropriate for early diagnosis. Lack of knowledge of the severity of the symptoms may be one cause for this delay. Our review is largely focused on the ongoing developments of early diagnosis in the study of biomarkers, circulating DNA for diagnosis, the biology of early challenges, early symptoms, liquid biopsies, detectable by imaging, established tumor markers, plasma DNA technologies, gender differences, and artificial intelligence (AI) in diagnosis. This review aims to determine and evaluate Indicators for detecting early cancer, assessing medical conditions, and evaluating potential risks.

Patients with recurrent seizures often present with cognitive impairment. However, it is unclear how seizures, even when infrequent, produce long-lasting deficits in cognition. One mechanism may be seizure-induced expression of DeltaFosB, a long-lived transcription factor that persistently regulates expression of plasticity-related genes and drives cognitive dysfunction. We previously found that, compared with cognitively-intact subjects, the activity-dependent expression of DeltaFosB in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) was increased in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and in individuals with AD. In MCI patients, higher DeltaFosB expression corresponded to lower Mini-Mental State Examination scores. Surgically resected DG tissue from patients with temporal lobe epilepsy also showed robust DeltaFosB expression; however, it is unclear whether DeltaFosB expression also corresponds to cognitive dysfunction in non-AD-related epilepsy. To test whether DG DeltaFosB expression is indicative of cognitive impairment in epilepsies with different etiologies, we assessed DeltaFosB expression in surgically-resected hippocampal tissue from 33 patients with childhood epilepsies who had undergone Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC) testing prior to surgery. We found that DeltaFosB expression is inversely correlated with Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient (FSIQ) in patients with mild to severe intellectual disability (FSIQ < 85). Our data indicate that DeltaFosB expression corresponds to cognitive impairment in epilepsies with different etiologies, supporting the hypothesis that DeltaFosB may epigenetically regulate gene expression and impair cognition across a wide range of epilepsy syndromes.",

Methods: The platform contains evidence-based information on various drugs grouped by medical specialty, and also records and saves patient appointments. It has specific service protocols for service standardization, including artificial intelligence, to allow agility in services and escalation. All data is protected by privacy and professional ethics guidelines. Results: The telepharmacy platform is ready and currently undergoing testing for ground applications through validation studies in hospitals or medical clinics.

            "chunk": "With the exponential advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, the realm of medicine is experiencing a paradigm shift, engendering a multitude of prospects and trials for healthcare practitioners, encompassing those devoted to the practice of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). This study explores the evolving landscape for TCM practitioners in the AI era, emphasizing that while AI can be helpful, it cannot replace the role of TCM practitioners. It is paramount to underscore the intrinsic worth of human expertise, accentuating that artificial intelligence (AI) is merely an instrument. On the one hand, AI-enabled tools like intelligent symptom checkers, diagnostic assistance systems, and personalized treatment plans can augment TCM practitioners' expertise and capacity, improving diagnosis accuracy and treatment efficacy. AI-empowered collaborations between Western medicine and TCM can strengthen holistic care. On the other hand, AI may disrupt conventional TCM workflow and doctor-patient relationships. Maintaining the humanistic spirit of TCM while embracing AI requires upholding professional ethics and establishing appropriate regulations. To leverage AI while retaining the essence of TCM, practitioners need to hone holistic analytical skills and see AI as complementary. By highlighting promising applications and potential risks of AI in TCM, this study provides strategic insights for stakeholders to promote the integrated development of AI and TCM for better patient outcomes. With proper implementation, AI can become a valuable assistant for TCM practitioners to elevate healthcare quality.",

Digital applications already used in orthopaedic surgery include telemedical support, online video consultations, monitoring of patients using wearables, smart devices, surgical navigation, robotic-assisted surgery, and applications of artificial intelligence in forms of medical image processing, three-dimensional (3D)-modelling, and simulations. In addition to that immersive technologies like virtual, augmented, and mixed reality are increasingly used in training but also rehabilitative and surgical settings.

            "chunk": "In the domain of healthcare, most importantly pediatric healthcare, the role of artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly impacted the medical field. Congenital heart diseases represent a group of heart diseases that are known to be some of the most critical cardiac conditions present at birth. These heart diseases need a swift diagnosis as well as an intervention to ensure the wellbeing of newborns. Fortunately, with the help of AI, including the highly advanced algorithms, analytics and imaging involved, it provides us with a promising era for neonatal care. This article reviewed published data in PubMed, Science Direct, UpToDate, and Google Scholar between the years 2015-2023. To conclude The use of artificial intelligence in detecting congenital heart diseases has shown great promise in improving the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosis. Several studies have demonstrated the efficacy of AI-based approaches for diagnosing congenital heart diseases, with results indicating that the systems can achieve high levels of sensitivity and specificity. In addition, AI can help reduce the workload of healthcare professionals allowing them to focus on other critical aspects of patient care. Despite the potential benefits of using AI, in addition to detecting congenital heart disease, there are still some challenges to overcome, such as the need for large amounts of high-quality data and the requirement for careful validation of the algorithms. Nevertheless, with ongoing research and development, AI is likely to become an increasingly valuable tool for improving the diagnosis and treatment of congenital heart diseases.",

However, genetic and environmental influences on these associations have not been studied, and it remains unclear whether music training can causally increase verbal ability. In a sample of 1,336 male twins, we tested the associations between verbal ability measured at time of conscription at age 18 and two music related variables: overall musical aptitude and total amount of music training before the age of 18. We estimated the amount of specific genetic and environmental influences on the association between verbal ability and musical aptitude, over and above the factors shared with general intelligence, using classical twin modelling. Further, we tested whether music training could causally influence verbal ability using a co-twin-control analysis. Musical aptitude and music training were significantly associated with verbal ability. Controlling for general intelligence only slightly attenuated the correlations. The partial association between musical aptitude and verbal ability, corrected for general intelligence, was mostly explained by shared genetic factors (50%) and non-shared environmental influences (35%). The co-twin-control-analysis gave no support for causal effects of early music training on verbal ability at age 18. Overall, our findings in a sizeable population sample converge with known associations between the music and language domains, while results from twin modelling suggested that this reflected a shared underlying aetiology rather than causal transfer.",

Its use in this field will inevitably change clinical practice, the patient-caregiver relationship and the concept of the diagnosis and treatment pathway, affecting the balance between the patient's right to self-determination and health, and thus leading to an evolution of the concept of informed consent. The aim was to characterize the guidelines for the use of artificial intelligence, its areas of application and the relevant legislation, to propose guiding principles for the design of optimal informed consent for its use. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A classic review by keywords on the main search engines was conducted. An analysis of the guidelines and regulations issued by scientific authorities and legal bodies on the use of artificial intelligence in public health was carried out. RESULTS: The current areas of application of this technology were highlighted, divided into sectors, its impact on them, as well as a summary of current guidelines and legislation. DISCUSSION: The ethical implications of artificial intelligence in the health care system were assessed, particularly regarding the therapeutic alliance between doctor and patient, and the balance between the right to self-determination and health. Finally, given the evolution of informed consent in relation to the use of this new technology, seven guiding principles were proposed to guarantee the right to the most informed consent or dissent.",

The effect of anticancer drug treatment varies significantly depending on individual patients and the extent of drug resistance. In this study, we developed a validation system based on an organ-on-a-chip integrated with artificial intelligence technologies to predict resistance to anticancer drugs in bladder cancer. As a proof-of-concept, we utilized the gemcitabine-resistant bladder cancer cell line T24 with four distinct levels of drug resistance (parental, early, intermediate, and late). These cells were co-cultured with endothelial cells in a 3D microfluidic chip. A dataset comprising 2,674 cell images from the chips was analyzed using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to distinguish the extent of drug resistance among the four cell groups. The CNN achieved 95.2% accuracy upon employing data augmentation and a step decay learning rate with an initial value of 0.001. The average diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were 90.5% and 96.8%, respectively, and all area under the curve (AUC) values were over 0.988. Our proposed method demonstrated excellent performance in accurately identifying the extent of drug resistance, which can assist in the prediction of drug responses and in determining the appropriate treatment for bladder cancer patients.",

Additionally, the occurrence of significant side effects may render the use of psychotropic medications untenable. However, Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS), a non-invasive brain stimulation technique, shows promising results in treating ADHD. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the efficacy and safety of tDCS on the performance of children and adolescents with ADHD in neuropsychological tests involving visual attention, visual and verbal working memory, and inhibitory control. METHODOLOGY: This study was a triple-blind, randomized, sham-controlled, crossover clinical trial. The intervention consisted of a daily session of tDCS (2 mA) or sham targeting the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC), for 30 min, on five consecutive days. The primary outcome was change in the Visual Attention Test, Fourth Edition (TAVIS-4) before and after each intervention. Subjects were also evaluated pre and post-tDCS using the Digit Span subtest of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Fifth Edition (WISC-V), the Developmental Neuropsychological Assessment, Second Edition (NEPSY-II) Inhibiting Response (IR) subtest, and the Corsi Block-Tapping Task. RESULTS: Fifteen individuals were included, and no statistically significant difference was observed when comparing the results of the TAVIS-4, the IR of NEPSY-II, and the intragroup Digit Span subtest of WISC-V undertaken before and after the procedure. Adverse events were mainly self-limiting and transient. The participants did not perceive any benefit from tDCS when measured on the Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) Scale. CONCLUSION: This study did not meet its primary endpoint and found no performance enhancement in any investigated neuropsychological outcomes relating to the intervention group.",

Current testing technologies, which cannot achieve rapid detection in the field, have a risk of slowing down the response time to the disease. In addition, there is still no epidemic surveillance system, implementing prevention and control measures is slow and inefficient. Motivated by these clinical needs, a sample-to-answer genetic diagnosis platform based on light-controlled capillary modified with a photocleavable linker is first developed, which could perform nucleic acid separation and release by light irradiation in less than 30 seconds. Then, on site polymerase chain reaction was performed in a handheld closed-loop convective system. Test reports are available within 20 min. Because this method is portable, rapid, and easy to operate, it has great potential for point-of-care testing. Additionally, through multiple device networking, a real-time artificial intelligence monitoring system for pathogens was developed on a cloud server. Through data reception, analysis, and visualization, the system can send early warning signals for disease control and prevention. Thus, anti-epidemic measures can be implemented effectively, and deploying and running this system can improve the capabilities for the prevention and control of infectious diseases.",

Numerous clinical trials with stem/progenitor cell-based therapy (SCT) for HF have demonstrated encouraging results, but not without limitations or discrepancies. Recent technological advancements in multiomics, bioinformatics, precision medicine, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML) provide new approaches and insights for stem cell research and therapeutic development. Integration of these new technologies into stem/progenitor cell therapy for HF may help address: 1) the technical challenges to obtain reliable and high-quality therapeutic precursor cells, 2) the discrepancies between preclinical and clinical studies, and 3) the personalized selection of optimal therapeutic cell types/populations for individual patients in the context of precision medicine. This review summarizes the current status of SCT for HF in clinics and provides new perspectives on the development of computation-aided SCT in the era of precision medicine and AI/ML.",

            "chunk": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods, particularly Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), have shown great promise in a range of medical imaging tasks. However, the susceptibility of DNNs to producing erroneous outputs under the presence of input noise and variations is of great concern and one of the largest challenges to their adoption in medical settings. Towards addressing this challenge, we explore the robustness of DNNs trained for chest radiograph classification under a range of perturbations reflective of clinical settings. We propose RoMIA, a framework for the creation of Robust Medical Imaging AI models. RoMIA adds three key steps to the model training and deployment flow: (i) Noise-added training, wherein a part of the training data is synthetically transformed to represent common noise sources, (ii) Fine-tuning with input mixing, in which the model is refined with inputs formed by mixing data from the original training set with a small number of images from a different source, and (iii) DCT-based denoising, which removes a fraction of high-frequency components of each image before applying the model to classify it. We applied RoMIA to create six different robust models for classifying chest radiographs using the CheXpert dataset. We evaluated the models on the CheXphoto dataset, which consists of naturally and synthetically perturbed images intended to evaluate robustness. Models produced by RoMIA show 3%-5% improvement in robust accuracy, which corresponds to an average reduction of 22.6% in misclassifications. These results suggest that RoMIA can be a useful step towards enabling the adoption of AI models in medical imaging applications.",

On the other hand, Artificial intelligence (AI) helps genome editing achieve more precision, efficiency, and affordability in tackling various diseases, like Sickle cell anemia or Thalassemia. AI models have been in use for designing guide RNAs (gRNAs) for CRISPR-Cas systems. Tools like DeepCRISPR, CRISTA, and DeepHF have the capability to predict optimal guide RNAs (gRNAs) for a specified target sequence. These predictions take into account multiple factors, including genomic context, Cas protein type, desired mutation type, on-target/off-target scores, potential off-target sites, and the potential impacts of genome editing on gene function and cell phenotype. These models aid in optimizing different genome editing technologies, such as base, prime, and epigenome editing, which are advanced techniques to introduce precise and programmable changes to DNA sequences without relying on the homology-directed repair pathway or donor DNA templates. Furthermore, AI, in collaboration with genome editing and precision medicine, enables personalized treatments based on genetic profiles. AI analyzes patients' genomic data to identify mutations, variations, and biomarkers associated with different diseases like Cancer, Diabetes, Alzheimer's, etc. However, several challenges persist, including high costs, off-target editing, suitable delivery methods for CRISPR cargoes, improving editing efficiency, and ensuring safety in clinical applications. This review explores AI's contribution to improving CRISPR-based genome editing technologies and addresses existing challenges. It also discusses potential areas for future research in AI-driven CRISPR-based genome editing technologies. The integration of AI and genome editing opens up new possibilities for genetics, biomedicine, and healthcare, with significant implications for human health.",

The aim of this work was to apply a predictive model to identify high-risk patients in the early stages of CKD as a means to provide early intervention to avert or delay kidney function deterioration. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using the data from the National Diabetes Database in Singapore, we applied a machine-learning algorithm to develop a predictive model for CKD progression in diabetic patients and to deploy the model nationwide. RESULTS: Our model was rigorously validated. It outperformed existing models and clinician predictions. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of our model is 0.88, with the 95% confidence interval being 0.87 to 0.89. In recognition of its higher and consistent accuracy and clinical usefulness, our CKD model became the first clinical model deployed nationwide in Singapore and has been incorporated into a national program to engage patients in long-term care plans in battling chronic diseases. The risk score generated by the model stratifies patients into three risk levels, which are embedded into the Diabetes Patient Dashboard for clinicians and care managers who can then allocate healthcare resources accordingly. CONCLUSION: This project provided a successful example of how an artificial intelligence (AI)-based model can be adopted to support clinical decision-making nationwide.",

            "chunk": "The adoption of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) systems in healthcare is transforming the healthcare-delivery landscape. Artificial intelligence may enhance patient safety and improve healthcare outcomes, but it presents notable ethical and legal dilemmas. Moreover, as AI streamlines the analysis of the multitude of factors relevant to malpractice claims, including informed consent, adherence to standards of care, and causation, the evaluation of professional liability might also benefit from its use. Beginning with an analysis of the basic steps in assessing professional liability, this article examines the potential new medical-legal issues that an expert witness may encounter when analyzing malpractice cases and the potential integration of AI in this context. These changes related to the use of integrated AI, will necessitate efforts on the part of judges, experts, and clinicians, and may require new legislative regulations. A new expert witness will be likely necessary in the evaluation of professional liability cases. On the one hand, artificial intelligence will support the expert witness; however, on the other hand, it will introduce specific elements into the activities of healthcare workers. These elements will necessitate an expert witness with a specialized cultural background. Examining the steps of professional liability assessment indicates that the likely path for AI in legal medicine involves its role as a collaborative and integrated tool. The combination of AI with human judgment in these assessments can enhance comprehensiveness and fairness. However, it is imperative to adopt a cautious and balanced approach to prevent complete automation in this field.",

This paper investigates the ability of a Deep Learning (DL) approach to predict future disease diagnosis from Electronic Health Records (EHR) for the purposes of Population Health Management. METHODS: In this study, embeddings were created using a Word2Vec algorithm from structured vocabulary commonly used in EHRs e.g., Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) codes. This study is based on longitudinal medical data from ~50 m patients in the USA. We introduced a novel method of including binned observation values into an embeddings model. We also included novel features associated with wider determinants of health. Patient records comprising these embeddings were then fed to a Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model to predict the likelihood of patients developing Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disorder (COPD), Hypertension or experiencing an Acute Myocardial Infarction (MI) in the next 3 years. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values were calculated to achieve model explainability. RESULTS: Increasing the data scope to include binned observations and wider determinants of health was found to improve predictive performance. We achieved an area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve value of 0.92 for Diabetes prediction, 0.94 for COPD, 0.92 for Hypertension and 0.94 for MI. The SHAP values showed that the models had learned features known to be associated with these outcomes. DISCUSSION: The DL approach outlined in this study can identify clinically-relevant features from large-scale EHR data and use these to predict future disease outcomes. This study highlights the promise of DL solutions for identifying patients at future risk of disease and providing clinicians with the means to understand and evaluate the drivers of those predictions.",

Current researchs show that humanistic caring ability is affected by emotional intelligence, empathy, interpersonal communication. But the exact relationship and internal mechanism of such factors have not been fully understood. OBJECTIVE: To explore the multiple mediating effect of empathy and communication ability on nursing students' emotional intelligence and caring ability. METHODS: A case study was conducted by examining a sample of 1,165 nursing students from a junior college in Anhui, China. The multidimensional scales, and a self-designed demographic characteristics questionnaire were utilized. Path relationships and mutual effects were tested using structural equation modeling (SEM). RESULTS: Emotional intelligence, empathy, and communication ability were found to positively affect nursing students' caring ability, as well as positive interrelationships with one another (standardized estimate = 0.312-0.584, p < 0.001). Communication ability and empathy play an important role in mediating the association between emotional intelligence and caring ability, and the effect sizes are 0.169 and 0.121, respectively, while the effect value of empathy and communication ability in emotional intelligence and caring ability was 0.034, which showed partial mediation of the association. The indirect effect of the structural equation was 77.14%. CONCLUSION: The chain mediating role of empathy and communication ability in emotional intelligence and caring ability is explored, which not only enrichis previous studies, but also reveals the mechanism of emotional intelligence's influence on caring ability. It is essential to continuously improve nursing students' caring ability. From the perspective of nursing educators, they need to develop targeted approaches to help the nursing student improve their emotional intelligence, empathy, and communication skills, further enhancing their caring ability.",

So, where do we see the field of artificial intelligence (AI) in bioinformatics going in the next 30 years? That was the theme of a \"No-Boundary Thinking\" Session as part of the Mid-South Computational Bioinformatics Society's (MCBIOS) 19th annual meeting in Irving, Texas. This session addressed various areas of AI in an open discussion and raised some perspectives on how popular tools like ChatGPT can be integrated into bioinformatics, communicating with scientists in different fields to properly utilize the potential of these algorithms, and how to continue educational outreach to further interest of data science and informatics to the next-generation of scientists.",

The World Health Organization (WHO) introduced an infection prevention and control (IPC) framework to mitigate the impact of HAIs, crucial for ensuring patient safety in hospitals. HAIs acquired after hospitalization pose significant challenges due to factors such as compromised immunity, invasive medical procedures, and antibiotic-resistant pathogens, which have dire consequences, including higher mortality rates and increased healthcare costs. Healthcare workers (HCWs) are critical in implementing IPC measures. Infection control programs that include strategies such as hand hygiene, personal protective equipment (PPE), environmental cleaning, and surveillance have become standard. However, challenges such as resistance to change, resource limitations, patient turnover, and variability in patient conditions persist. Strategies to maintain hospital infection control involve rigorous compliance monitoring, staff education, advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), telemedicine, and innovative sanitation methods. The future of hospital infection control may involve increased integration of environmental monitoring, antimicrobial stewardship, and patient participation while leveraging collaboration among healthcare facilities. The review highlights the criticality of hospital infection control and suggests trends and opportunities to strengthen prevention efforts and patient safety.",

AI provides broad utility options through structured, standardised, and digitally driven elements in medical research. The clinical trials are a time-consuming process with patient recruitment, enrolment, frequent monitoring, and medical adherence and retention. With an AI-powered tool, the automated data can be generated and managed for the trial lifecycle with all the records of the medical history of the patient as patient-centric AI. AI can intelligently interpret the data, feed downstream systems, and automatically fill out the required analysis report. This article explains how AI has revolutionised innovative ways of collecting data, biosimulation, and early disease diagnosis for clinical trials and overcomes the challenges more precisely through cost and time reduction, improved efficiency, and improved drug development research with less need for rework.

However, all-optical diffractive neural networks provide a possible solution to this challenge. They can outperform conventional silicon-based electronic neural networks due to the significantly higher speed of the propagation of optical signals ( approximately 108 m.s-1) compared to electrical signals ( approximately 105 m.s-1), their parallelism in nature, and their low power consumption. The integrated diffractive deep neural network (ID2NN) uses an on-chip fully passive photonic approach to achieve the functionality of neural networks (matrix-vector operations) and can be fabricated via the CMOS process, which is technologically more amenable to implementing an artificial intelligence processor. In this paper, we present a detailed design framework for the integrated diffractive deep neural network and corresponding silicon-on-insulator integration implementation through Python-based simulations.

Although the skull, the skeleton or the hand-wrist are used in age estimation as maturity indicators, they often present a lack of good conditions for a correct identification or estimation. Few systematic reviews (SRs) have been recently published; therefore, this umbrella review critically assesses their level of evidence and provides a general, comprehensive view. Materials and methods: Considering the review question \"What is the current evidence on age determination approaches in Forensic Dentistry?\" an electronic database search was conducted in four databases (PubMed, Cochrane, WoS, LILACS) up to December 2022, focusing on SRs of age estimation through forensic dentistry procedures. The methodological quality was analyzed using the measurement tool to assess SRs criteria (AMSTAR2). Results: Eighteen SRs were included: five of critically low quality, six of low quality, three of moderate quality and four of high quality. The SRs posited that Willems' method is more accurate and less prone to overestimation; most methods seem to be geographically sensitive; and 3D-imaging and artificial intelligence tools demonstrate high potential. Conclusions: The quality of evidence on age estimation using dental approaches was rated as low to moderate. Well-designed clinical trials and high-standard systematic reviews are essential to corroborate the accuracy of the different procedures for age estimation in forensic dentistry.",

Here, we review recent theoretical advances in describing sentience and free will as fundamental aspects of reality granted by quantum physical laws. Modern quantum information theory considers quantum states as a physical resource that endows quantum systems with the capacity to perform physical tasks that are classically impossible. Reductive identification of conscious experiences with the quantum information comprised in quantum brain states allows for causally potent consciousness that is capable of performing genuine choices for future courses of physical action. The consequent evolution of brain cortical networks contributes to increased computational power, memory capacity, and cognitive intelligence of the living organisms.",

However, detailed experimental evidence for the antinociceptive effects of many of these minor cannabinoids remains lacking. Here, we employed artificial intelligence (AI) to perform compound-protein interaction estimates with cannabichromene (CBC) and receptors involved in nociceptive signaling. Based on our findings, we investigated the antinociceptive properties of CBC in naive or neuropathic C57BL/6 male and female mice using von Frey (mechanical allodynia), tail-flick (noxious radiant heat), formalin (acute and persistent inflammatory pain), and acetone (cold thermal) tests. For von Frey assessments, CBC dose (0-20 mg/kg, i.p.) and time (0-6 h) responses were measured in male and female neuropathic mice. For tail-flick, formalin, and acetone assays, CBC (20 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered to naive male and female mice 1 h prior to testing. The results show that CBC (10 and 20 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly reduced mechanical allodynia in neuropathic male and female mice 1-2 h after treatment. Additionally, CBC treatment caused significant reductions in nociceptive behaviors in the tail-flick assay and in both phase 1 and phase 2 of the formalin test. Finally, we found a significant interaction in neuropathic male mice in the acetone test. In conclusion, our results suggest that CBC targets receptors involved in nociceptive signaling and imparts antinociceptive properties that may benefit males and females afflicted with diverse forms of acute or chronic/persistent pain.",

This cross-sectional instrument validation study, as a part of the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Project, included 160 patients (320 eyes) with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). After the standard indirect slit-lamp fundoscopy, each patient first underwent fundus photography with a standard 45 degrees  camera VISUCAM Zeiss and then with a hand-held camera TANG (Shanghai Zhi Tang Health Technology Co., Ltd.). Two retina specialists independently graded the images taken with the standard camera, while the images taken with the hand-held camera were graded using the DeepDR system and an independent IDF ophthalmologist. The three screening methods did not differ in detecting moderate/severe nonproliferative and proliferative DR. The area under the curve, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, kappa (k) agreement, diagnostic odds ratio, and diagnostic effectiveness for a hand-held camera compared to clinical examination were 0.921, 89.1%, 100%, 100%, 91.4%, infinity, 0.11, 0.86, 936.48, and 94.9%, while compared to the standard fundus camera were 0.883, 83.2%, 100%, 100%, 87.3%, infinity, 0.17, 0.78, 574.6, and 92.2%. The results of our study suggest that fundus photography with a hand-held camera and AI-based grading system is a short, simple, and accurate method for the screening and early detection of DR, comparable to clinical examination and fundus photography with a standard camera.",

We also identify several tools, such as Combi, GenNet, and GMSTool, specifically designed to integrate these methods for hypothesis-free analysis of genetic variation data. We elaborate on the additional value and limitations of these tools from a geneticist's perspective. Finally, we discuss the fast-moving field of foundation models and large multi-modal omics biobank initiatives.",

            "chunk": "More than 10 million Europeans show signs of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a transitional stage between normal brain aging and dementia stage memory disorder. The path MCI takes can be divergent; while some maintain stability or even revert to cognitive norms, alarmingly, up to half of the cases progress to dementia within 5 years. Current diagnostic practice lacks the necessary screening tools to identify those at risk of progression. The European patient experience often involves a long journey from the initial signs of MCI to the eventual diagnosis of dementia. The trajectory is far from ideal. Here, we introduce the AI-Mind project, a pioneering initiative with an innovative approach to early risk assessment through the implementation of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) on multimodal data. The cutting-edge AI-based tools developed in the project aim not only to accelerate the diagnostic process but also to deliver highly accurate predictions regarding an individual's risk of developing dementia when prevention and intervention may still be possible. AI-Mind is a European Research and Innovation Action (RIA H2020-SC1-BHC-06-2020, No. 964220) financed between 2021 and 2026. First, the AI-Mind Connector identifies dysfunctional brain networks based on high-density magneto- and electroencephalography (M/EEG) recordings. Second, the AI-Mind Predictor predicts dementia risk using data from the Connector, enriched with computerized cognitive tests, genetic and protein biomarkers, as well as sociodemographic and clinical variables. AI-Mind is integrated within a network of major European initiatives, including The Virtual Brain, The Virtual Epileptic Patient, and EBRAINS AISBL service for sensitive data, HealthDataCloud, where big patient data are generated for advancing digital and virtual twin technology development. AI-Mind's innovation lies not only in its early prediction of dementia risk, but it also enables a virtual laboratory scenario for hypothesis-driven personalized intervention research. This article introduces the background of the AI-Mind project and its clinical study protocol, setting the stage for future scientific contributions.",

This study aims to evaluate the impact of MBCT adjunctive treatment on these variables. Main hypothesis was that MBCT would improve cognitive functioning and BDNF more than Psychoeducation and TAU. METHODS: Randomized, multicenter, prospective and single-blinded trial. Included BD outpatients randomly assigned to three treatment arms: MBCT plus treatment as usual (TAU), Psychoeducation plus Tau and TAU. Cognitive functions were assessed with Continuous Performance Test-III, Stroop Test, Trail Making Test, Digit Span and Letter-Number Sequencing from Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale III, Face Emotion Identification Task and Face Emotion Discrimination Task. BDNF serum level was measured with ELISA. Patients were assessed at baseline, 8 weeks and 6 months. RESULTS: Eighty-four patients were recruited (TAU = 10, Psychoeducation = 34, MBCT = 40). No significant differences between treatment groups were found. MBCT does not achieve better results than Psychoeducation or TAU. DISCUSSION: Being Psychoeducation and TAU efficient interventions, as well as the scarce duration of a more complex intervention, such as MBCT, are suggested as explanatory variables of these results.

They are widely used in several domains such as manufacturing and automotive to enable achieving specific quality goals. In the health domain, so-called digital patient twins have been understood as virtual models of patients generated from population data and/or patient data, including, for example, real-time feedback from wearables. Along with the growing impact of data science technologies like artificial intelligence, novel health data ecosystems centered around digital patient twins could be developed. This paves the way for improved health monitoring and facilitation of personalized therapeutics based on management, analysis, and interpretation of medical data via digital patient twins. The utility and feasibility of digital patient twins in routine medical processes are still limited, despite practical endeavors to create digital twins of physiological functions, single organs, or holistic models. Moreover, reliable simulations for the prediction of individual drug responses are still missing. However, these simulations would be one important milestone for truly personalized therapeutics. Another prerequisite for this would be individualized pharmaceutical manufacturing with subsequent obstacles, such as low automation, scalability, and therefore high costs. Additionally, regulatory challenges must be met thus calling for more digitalization in this area. Therefore, this narrative mini-review provides a discussion on the potentials and limitations of digital patient twins, focusing on their potential bridging function for personalized therapeutics and an individualized pharmaceutical manufacturing while also looking at the regulatory impacts.",

Although the image reading by radiologists is useful for evaluating suspected facial fractures, there are certain challenges in human-based diagnostics. Artificial intelligence (AI) is making a quantum leap in radiology, producing significant improvements of reports and workflows. Here, an updated literature review is presented on the impact of AI in facial trauma with a special reference to fracture detection in radiology. The purpose is to gain insights into the current development and demand for future research in facial trauma.

This paper addresses a well-defined problem pertaining to the critical need for a comprehensive examination of students' ChatGPT adoption in higher education. To examine such adoption, it is imperative to focus on measuring actual user behavior. While measuring students' ChatGPT usage behavior at a specific point in time can be valuable, a more holistic approach is necessary to understand the temporal dynamics of AI adoption. To address this need, a longitudinal survey was conducted, examining how students' ChatGPT usage behavior changes over time among students, and unveiling the drivers of such behavior change. The empirical examination of 222 Dutch higher education students revealed a significant decline in students' ChatGPT usage behavior over an 8 month period. This period was defined by two distinct data collection phases: the initial phase (T1) and a follow-up phase conducted 8 months later (T2). Furthermore, the results demonstrate that changes in trust, emotional creepiness, and Perceived Behavioral Control significantly predicted the observed change in usage behavior. The findings of this research carry significant academic and managerial implications, as they advance our comprehension of the temporal aspects of AI adoption in higher education. The findings also provide actionable guidance for AI developers and educational institutions seeking to optimize student engagement with AI technologies.",

            "chunk": "BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder associated with a significant negative impact. Early diagnosis and treatment of schizophrenia has a favorable effect on the clinical outcome and patients quality of life. In this context, machine learning techniques open up new opportunities for a more accurate diagnosis and prediction of the clinical features of this illness. AIM: This literature review is aimed to search for information on the use of machine learning techniques in the prediction and diagnosis of schizophrenia and the determination of its clinical features. METHODS: The Google Scholar, PubMed, and eLIBRARY.ru databases were used to search for relevant data. The review included articles that had been published not earlier than January 1, 2010, and not later than March 31, 2023. Combinations of the following keywords were applied for search queries: machine learning, deep learning, schizophrenia, neural network, predictors, artificial intelligence, diagnostics, suicide, depressive, insomnia, and cognitive. Original articles regardless of their design were included in the review. Descriptive analysis was used to summarize the retrieved data. RESULTS: Machine learning techniques are widely used in the functional assessment of patients with schizophrenia. They are used for interpretation of MRI, EEG, and actigraphy findings. Also, models created using machine learning algorithms can analyze speech, behavior, and the creativity of people and these data can be used for the diagnosis of psychiatric disorders. It has been found that different machine learning-based models can help specialists predict and diagnose schizophrenia based on medical history and genetic data, as well as epigenetic information. Machine learning techniques can also be used to build effective models that can help specialists diagnose and predict clinical manifestations and complications of schizophrenia, such as insomnia, depressive symptoms, suicide risk, aggressive behavior, and changes in cognitive functions over time. CONCLUSION: Machine learning techniques play an important role in psychiatry, as they have been used in models that help specialists in the diagnosis of schizophrenia and determination of its clinical features. The use of machine learning algorithms is one of the most promising direction in psychiatry, and it can significantly improve the effectiveness of the diagnosis and treatment of schizophrenia.",

Both diseases involve synaptic dysfunction, contributing to their clinical features. Synaptic biomarkers, representing proteins associated with synaptic function or structure, offer insights into disease mechanisms, progression, and treatment responses. These biomarkers can detect disease early, track its progression, and evaluate therapeutic efficacy. ALS is characterized by elevated neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood, correlating with disease progression. TDP-43 is another key ALS biomarker, its mislocalization linked to synaptic dysfunction. In FTD, TDP-43 and tau proteins are studied as biomarkers. Synaptic biomarkers like neuronal pentraxins (NPs), including neuronal pentraxin 2 (NPTX2), and neuronal pentraxin receptor (NPTXR), offer insights into FTD pathology and cognitive decline. Advanced technologies, like machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), aid biomarker discovery and drug development. Challenges in this research include technological limitations in detection, variability across patients, and translating findings from animal models. ML/AI can accelerate discovery by analyzing complex data and predicting disease outcomes. Synaptic biomarkers offer early disease detection, personalized treatment strategies, and insights into disease mechanisms. While challenges persist, technological advancements and interdisciplinary efforts promise to revolutionize the understanding and management of ALS and FTD. This review will explore the present comprehension of synaptic biomarkers in ALS and FTD and discuss their significance and emphasize the prospects and obstacles.",

With the increasing number of cases, researchers are trying to predict the prognosis of patients by using different data with artificial intelligence methods such as machine learning (ML). In this study, we aimed to predict mortality risk in COVID-19 patients using ML algorithms with different datasets. Methodology In this retrospective study, we evaluated the fever, oxygen saturation, laboratory results, thorax computed tomography (CT) findings, and comorbid diseases at admission to the hospital of 404 patients whose diagnosis was confirmed by the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test. Different datasets were created by combining the data. The Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique was used to reduce the imbalance in the dataset. K-nearest neighbors, support vector machine, stochastic gradient descent, random forest, neural network, naive Bayes, logistic regression, gradient boosting, XGBoost, and AdaBoost models were used to create the ML algorithm, and the accuracy rates of mortality prediction were compared. Results When the dataset was created with CT parenchyma score, pulmonary artery and inferior vena cava diameters, and laboratory results, mortality was predicted with an accuracy of 98.4% with the gradient boosting model. Conclusions The study demonstrates that patient prognosis can be accurately predicted using simple measurements from thorax CT scans and laboratory findings.",

However, their integration into the clinical workflow has been slow due to the lack of a consensus on data quality, benchmarked robust implementation, and consensus-based guidelines to ensure standardization and generalization. Contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) has improved sensitivity and specificity compared to current standards of breast cancer diagnostic imaging i.e., mammography (MG) and/or conventional ultrasound (US), with comparable accuracy to MRI (current diagnostic imaging benchmark), but at a much lower cost and higher throughput. This makes CEM an excellent tool for widespread breast lesion characterization for all women, including underserved and minority women. Underlining the critical need for early detection and accurate diagnosis of breast cancer, this review examines the limitations of conventional approaches and reveals how AI can help overcome them. The Methodical approaches, such as image processing, feature extraction, quantitative analysis, lesion classification, lesion segmentation, integration with clinical data, early detection, and screening support have been carefully analysed in recent studies addressing breast cancer detection and diagnosis. Recent guidelines described by Checklist for Artificial Intelligence in Medical Imaging (CLAIM) to establish a robust framework for rigorous evaluation and surveying has inspired the current review criteria.",

It helps to choose a robust machine learning (ML) model, usually used for data classification. AI has a large connection with image processing and feature classification, and it can also be successfully applied to analyzing fundus eye images. Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a disease that can cause vision loss and blindness, which, from an imaging point of view, can be shown when screening the eyes. Image processing tools can analyze and extract the features from fundus eye images, and these corroborate with ML classifiers that can perform their classification among different disease classes. The outcomes integrated into automated diagnostic systems can be a real success for physicians and patients. In this study, in the form image processing area, the manipulation of the contrast with the gamma correction parameter was applied because DR affects the blood vessels, and the structure of the eyes becomes disorderly. Therefore, the analysis of the texture with two types of entropies was necessary. Shannon and fuzzy entropies and contrast manipulation led to ten original features used in the classification process. The machine learning library PyCaret performs complex tasks, and the empirical process shows that of the fifteen classifiers, the gradient boosting classifier (GBC) provides the best results. Indeed, the proposed model can classify the DR degrees as normal or severe, achieving an accuracy of 0.929, an F1 score of 0.902, and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.941. The validation of the selected model with a bootstrap statistical technique was performed. The novelty of the study consists of the extraction of features from preprocessed fundus eye images, their classification, and the manipulation of the contrast in a controlled way.",

            "chunk-id": 1,
            "chunk": "A fundamental concept in psychological and intelligence testing involves the assumption of comparability in which performance on a test is compared to a normative standard derived from prior testing on individuals who are comparable to the examinee. When evaluating cognitive abilities, the primary variable used for establishing comparability and, in turn, validity is age, given that intellectual abilities develop largely as a function of general physical growth and neuromaturation. When an individual has been raised only in the language of the test, language development is effectively controlled by age. For example, when measuring vocabulary, a 12-year-old will be compared only to other 12-year-olds, all of whom have been learning the language of the test for approximately 12 years-hence, they remain comparable. The same cannot be said when measuring the same or other abilities in a 12-year-old who has been raised only in a different language or raised partly with a different language and partly with the language of the test. In such cases, a 12-year-old may have been learning the language of the test at some point shortly after birth, or they might have just begun learning the language a week ago. Their respective development in the language of the test thus varies considerably, and it can no longer be assumed that they are comparable in this respect to others simply because they are of the same age. Psychologists noted early on that language differences could affect test performance, but it was viewed mostly as an issue regarding basic comprehension. Early efforts were made to address this issue, which typically involved simplification of the instructions or reliance on mostly nonverbal methods of administration and measurement. Other procedures that followed included working around language via test modifications or alterations (e.g., use of an interpreter), testing in the dominant language, or use of tests translated into other languages. None of these approaches, however, have succeeded in establishing validity and fairness in the testing of multilinguals, primarily because they fail to recognize that language difference is not the same as language development, much like cultural difference is not the same as acquisition of acculturative knowledge. Current research demonstrates that the test performance of multilinguals is moderated primarily by the amount of exposure to and development in the language of the test. Moreover, language development, specifically receptive vocabulary, accounts for more variance in test performance than age or any other variable. There is further evidence that when the influence of differential language development is examined and controlled, historical attributions to race-based performance disappear. Advances in fairness in the testing of multilinguals rest on true peer comparisons that control for differences in language development within and among multilinguals. The BESA and the Ortiz PVAT are the only two examples where norms have been created that control for both age and degree of development in the language(s) of the test. Together, they provide a blueprint for future tests and test construction wherein the creation of true peer norms is possible and, when done correctly, exhibits significant influence in equalizing test performance across diverse groups, irrespective of racial/ethnic background or language development. Current research demonstrates convincingly that with deliberate and careful attention to differences that exist, not only between monolinguals and multilinguals of the same age but also among multilinguals themselves, tests can be developed to support claims of validity and fairness for use with individuals who were in fact not raised exclusively in the language or the culture of the test.",

The advent of a dedicated tool based on digital imaging, i.e., the retinal vessel analyzer, and also other software such as Integrative Vessel Analysis (IVAN), Singapore I Vessel Assessment (SIVA), and Vascular Assessment and Measurement Platform for Images of the Retina (VAMPIRE), has led to the accumulation of a formidable body of evidence regarding the prognostic value of retinal vessel analysis (RVA) for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease (including arterial hypertension in children). There is also the potential to monitor the response of retinal vessels to therapies such as physical activity or bariatric surgery. The dynamic vessel analyzer (DVA) remains a unique way of studying neurovascular coupling, helping to understand the pathogenesis of cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative conditions and also being complementary to techniques that measure macrovascular dysfunction. Beyond cardiovascular disease, retinal vessel analysis has shown associations with and prognostic value for neurological conditions, inflammation, kidney function, and respiratory disease. Artificial intelligence (AI) (represented by algorithms such as QUantitative Analysis of Retinal vessel Topology and siZe (QUARTZ), SIVA-DLS (SIVA-deep learning system), and many others) seems efficient in extracting information from fundus photographs, providing prognoses of various general conditions with unprecedented predictive value.

However, this advancement has also given rise to ethical challenges, notably in scholarly writing. AI's capacity to automate labor-intensive tasks like literature reviews and data analysis has created opportunities for unethical practices, with scholars incorporating AI-generated text into their manuscripts, potentially undermining academic integrity. This situation gives rise to a range of ethical dilemmas that not only question the authenticity of contemporary academic endeavors but also challenge the credibility of the peer-review process and the integrity of editorial oversight. Instances of this misconduct are highlighted, spanning from lesser-known journals to reputable ones, and even infiltrating graduate theses and grant applications. This subtle AI intrusion hints at a systemic vulnerability within the academic publishing domain, exacerbated by the publish-or-perish mentality. The solutions aimed at mitigating the unethical employment of AI in academia include the adoption of sophisticated AI-driven plagiarism detection systems, a robust augmentation of the peer-review process with an \"AI scrutiny\" phase, comprehensive training for academics on ethical AI usage, and the promotion of a culture of transparency that acknowledges AI's role in research. This review underscores the pressing need for collaborative efforts among academic nephrology institutions to foster an environment of ethical AI application, thus preserving the esteemed academic integrity in the face of rapid technological advancements. It also makes a plea for rigorous research to assess the extent of AI's involvement in the academic literature, evaluate the effectiveness of AI-enhanced plagiarism detection tools, and understand the long-term consequences of AI utilization on academic integrity. An example framework has been proposed to outline a comprehensive approach to integrating AI into Nephrology academic writing and peer review. Using proactive initiatives and rigorous evaluations, a harmonious environment that harnesses AI's capabilities while upholding stringent academic standards can be envisioned.",

Thus, cultivating these factors in the general population is important. Previous interventions have displayed substantial effects in certain areas. However, these interventions have primarily been Mindset oriented. This paper presents a novel intervention approach by also emphasizing the importance of brain development; the importance of stimuli for building a network in the brain; the importance of repetition for strengthening the network; and the importance of perseverance and deliberate practice for achievement. The purpose of the current study was to examine the effects of a 35-40 min online intervention to increase the beliefs of 'I CAN' for 38 university students in Norway. The mean age of the 38 participants was 22.55 (SD = 1.59) and they completed a pre-test assessment of the Grit-S Scale, Theories of Intelligence Scale (Mindset), General Self-Efficacy Scale, and Flourishing Scale (Well-Being). This was followed up by the novel intervention and finally a post-test of the scales eight weeks later. The results showed an increase in Grit, Self-Efficacy, and Well-Being. However, only Grit displayed a significant increase. We aimed at creating an intervention where the participants would \"turn on the switch\", meaning that they develop stronger beliefs.

The handcrafted descriptors were those representatives of multiscale and multidimensional fractal techniques (fractal dimension, lacunarity and percolation) applied to quantify the histological images with the corresponding representations via explainable artificial intelligence (xAI) approaches. The deep-learned features were obtained from different convolutional neural networks (DenseNet-121, EfficientNet-b2, Inception-V3, ResNet-50 and VGG-19). The descriptors were investigated through different associations. The most relevant combinations, defined through a ranking algorithm, were analyzed via a heterogeneous ensemble of classifiers with the support vector machine, naive Bayes, random forest and K-nearest neighbors algorithms. The proposed scheme was applied to histological samples representative of breast cancer, colorectal cancer, oral dysplasia and liver tissue. The best results were accuracy rates of 94.83% to 100%, with the identification of pattern ensembles for classifying multiple histological images. The computational scheme indicated solutions exploring a reduced number of features (a maximum of 25 descriptors) and with better performance values than those observed in the literature.

            "chunk": "As energy conversion systems continue to grow in complexity, pneumatic control valves may exhibit unexpected anomalies or trigger system shutdowns, leading to a decrease in system reliability. Consequently, the analysis of time-domain signals and the utilization of artificial intelligence, including deep learning methods, have emerged as pivotal approaches for addressing these challenges. Although deep learning is widely used for pneumatic valve fault diagnosis, the success of most deep learning methods depends on a large amount of labeled training data, which is often difficult to obtain. To address this problem, a novel fault diagnosis method based on the attention-weighted relation network (AWRN) is proposed to achieve fault detection and classification with small sample data. In the proposed method, fault diagnosis is performed through the relation network in few-shot learning, and in order to enhance the representativeness of feature extraction, the attention-weighted mechanism is introduced into the relation network. Finally, in order to verify the effectiveness of the method, a DA valve fault dataset is constructed, and experimental validation is performed on this dataset and another benchmark PU rolling bearing fault dataset. The results show that the accuracy of the network on DA is 99.15%, and the average accuracy on PU is 98.37%. Compared with the state-of-the-art diagnosis methods, the proposed method achieves higher accuracy while significantly reducing the amount of training data.",

However, the complex and imbalanced data with high dimensionality pose significant challenges for computational approaches and multi-omics data analysis. This study focuses on predicting skin cancer and analyzing overall survival probability. We employ the Kaplan-Meier estimator and Cox proportional hazards regression model, utilizing high-throughput machine learning (ML)-based ensemble methods. Our proposed ML-based ensemble techniques are applied to a publicly available dataset from the ICGC Data Portal, specifically targeting skin cutaneous melanoma cancers (SKCM). We used eight baseline classifiers, namely, random forest (RF), decision tree (DT), gradient boosting (GB), AdaBoost, Gaussian naive Bayes (GNB), extra tree (ET), logistic regression (LR), and light gradient boosting machine (Light GBM or LGBM). The study evaluated the performance of the proposed ensemble methods and survival analysis on SKCM. The proposed methods demonstrated promising results, outperforming other algorithms and models in terms of accuracy compared to traditional methods. Specifically, the RF classifier exhibited outstanding precision results. Additionally, four different ensemble methods (stacking, bagging, boosting, and voting) were created and trained to achieve optimal results. The performance was evaluated and interpreted using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, confusion matrix, and ROC curves, where the voting method achieved a promising accuracy of 99%. On the other hand, the RF classifier achieved an outstanding accuracy of 99%, which exhibits the best performance. We compared our proposed study with the existing state-of-the-art techniques and found significant improvements in several key aspects. Our approach not only demonstrated superior performance in terms of accuracy but also showcased remarkable efficiency. Thus, this research work contributes to diagnosing SKCM with high accuracy.",

While vanilla fine-tuning has shown to be effective, research on computer vision has recently proposed improved algorithms, promising better accuracy. While initial studies have demonstrated the benefits of these algorithms for medical AI, in particular for radiology, there is no empirical evidence for improved accuracy in histopathology. Therefore, based on the ConvNeXt architecture, our study performs a systematic comparison of nine task adaptation techniques, namely, DELTA, L(2)-SP, MARS-PGM, Bi-Tuning, BSS, MultiTune, SpotTune, Co-Tuning, and vanilla fine-tuning, on five histopathological classification tasks using eight datasets. The results are based on external testing and statistical validation and reveal a multifaceted picture: some techniques are better suited for histopathology than others, but depending on the classification task, a significant relative improvement in accuracy was observed for five advanced task adaptation techniques over the control method, i.e., vanilla fine-tuning (e.g., Co-Tuning: P(>>) = 0.942, d = 2.623). Furthermore, we studied the classification accuracy for three of the nine methods with respect to the training set size (e.g., Co-Tuning: P(>>) = 0.951, gamma = 0.748). Overall, our results show that the performance of advanced task adaptation techniques in histopathology is affected by influencing factors such as the specific classification task or the size of the training dataset.",

            "chunk": "A growing amount of research is being conducted on cultural intelligence (CQ), which is the ability to adjust and adapt successfully to a variety of surroundings. CQ is a vital quality for people in diversified societies, as are seen today. However, it is still unclear how an individual can develop or strengthen CQ because previous studies have shown that variables such as foreign experience and personality are not exclusively sufficient as CQ antecedents. If CQ can be treated health-scientifically, as the CQ developers argue, diet and exercise that are effective in keeping the body and brain healthy may also correlate with CQ. It is of great significance to clarify the relationship between lifestyle and CQ by applying recent previous research showing the relationship between CQ and both the brain and intelligence, as well as between lifestyle and both the brain and intelligence. Using data derived from 142 Japanese businesspersons, the results of structural equation modeling indicate that lifestyles (dietary balance and walking frequency) are significantly associated with CQ after controlling for personalities (curiosity and grit) and international experiences (length of studying and working abroad), which have been used as predictors of CQ in previous studies. Furthermore, the moderation test showed that the effect of dietary balance on increasing CQ is greater for people with less overseas experience, indicating that dietary balance compensates for lack of overseas experience in the effect of maintaining the level of CQ. These suggest the effectiveness of a health-scientific approach to the influencing factors of CQ. This study is the first to show that CQ is influenced by lifestyle such as walking and dieting, in addition to personality and overseas experience, and will contribute to the future development of health science and cross-cultural research.",

In this study, we developed a new artificial intelligence (AI) system to overcome the limitations of requiring specialists to manually process datasets and a large amount of computer resources. METHODS: The AI system comprises a tumor image filter, which extracts MRI slices containing tumors, and sarcoma evaluator, which diagnoses uterine sarcomas. We used 15 types of MRI patient sequences to train deep neural network (DNN) models used by tumor filter and sarcoma evaluator with 8 cross-validation sets. We implemented tumor filter and sarcoma evaluator using ensemble prediction technique with 9 DNN models. Ten tumor filters and sarcoma evaluator sets were developed to evaluate fluctuation accuracy. Finally, AutoDiag-AI was used to evaluate the new validation dataset, including 8 cases of sarcomas and 24 leiomyomas. RESULTS: Tumor image filter and sarcoma evaluator accuracies were 92.68% and 90.50%, respectively. AutoDiag-AI with the original dataset accuracy was 89.32%, with 90.47% sensitivity and 88.95% specificity, whereas AutoDiag-AI with the new validation dataset accuracy was 92.44%, with 92.25% sensitivity and 92.50% specificity. CONCLUSION: Our newly established AI system automatically extracts tumor sites from MRI images and diagnoses them as uterine sarcomas without human intervention. Its accuracy is comparable to that of a radiologist. With further validation, the system could be applied for diagnosis of other diseases. Further improvement of the system's accuracy may enable its clinical application in the future.",

One of the main open problems is the lack of ergodicity, or mode collapse, for typical stochastic solvers based on Monte Carlo techniques leading to poor generalization or lack of robustness to uncertainties. Currently, there is no universal metric to quantify such performance deficiencies across various solvers. Here, we introduce a new diversity measure for quantifying the number of independent approximate solutions for NP-hard optimization problems. Among others, it allows benchmarking solver performance by a required time-to-diversity (TTD), a generalization of often used time-to-solution (TTS). We illustrate this metric by comparing the sampling power of various quantum annealing strategies. In particular, we show that the inhomogeneous quantum annealing schedules can redistribute and suppress the emergence of topological defects by controlling space-time separated critical fronts, leading to an advantage over standard quantum annealing schedules with respect to both TTS and TTD for finding rare solutions. Using path-integral Monte Carlo simulations for up to 1600 qubits, we demonstrate that nonequilibrium driving of quantum fluctuations, guided by efficient approximate tensor network contractions, can significantly reduce the fraction of hard instances for random frustrated 2D spin glasses with local fields. Specifically, we observe that by creating a class of algorithmic quantum phase transitions, the diversity of solutions can be enhanced by up to 40% with the fraction of hard-to-sample instances reducing by more than 25%.",

            "chunk": "BACKGROUND: Psychiatry is a specialized field of medicine that focuses on the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of mental health disorders. With advancements in technology and the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), there has been a growing interest in exploring the potential of AI language models systems, such as Chat Generative Pre-training Transformer (ChatGPT), to assist in the field of psychiatry. OBJECTIVE: Our study aimed to evaluates the effectiveness, reliability and safeness of ChatGPT in assisting patients with mental health problems, and to assess its potential as a collaborative tool for mental health professionals through a simulated interaction with three distinct imaginary patients. METHODS: Three imaginary patient scenarios (cases A, B, and C) were created, representing different mental health problems. All three patients present with, and seek to eliminate, the same chief complaint (i.e., difficulty falling asleep and waking up frequently during the night in the last 2 degrees weeks). ChatGPT was engaged as a virtual psychiatric assistant to provide responses and treatment recommendations. RESULTS: In case A, the recommendations were relatively appropriate (albeit non-specific), and could potentially be beneficial for both users and clinicians. However, as complexity of clinical cases increased (cases B and C), the information and recommendations generated by ChatGPT became inappropriate, even dangerous; and the limitations of the program became more glaring. The main strengths of ChatGPT lie in its ability to provide quick responses to user queries and to simulate empathy. One notable limitation is ChatGPT inability to interact with users to collect further information relevant to the diagnosis and management of a patient's clinical condition. Another serious limitation is ChatGPT inability to use critical thinking and clinical judgment to drive patient's management. CONCLUSION: As for July 2023, ChatGPT failed to give the simple medical advice given certain clinical scenarios. This supports that the quality of ChatGPT-generated content is still far from being a guide for users and professionals to provide accurate mental health information. It remains, therefore, premature to conclude on the usefulness and safety of ChatGPT in mental health practice.",

Digital interventions to promote PA in inactive adults may improve health and well-being by being available, personalized and adequate. Knowledge on users' adoption, acceptability and sustainability of digital interventions to promote PA is still limited. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the adoption, acceptability and sustained use of three digital interventions for promoting PA among inactive adults. DESIGN: A randomized control trial (ONWARDS) with 183 participants assigned to 3 groups and followed up for 18 months. All participants received a wearable activity tracker with the personalized metric Personal Activity Intelligence (PAI) on a mobile app, two groups received additional access to online training and one group had also access to online social support. METHODS: A mixed-methods approach was used to address the study objective. Acceptability was evaluated through the System Usability Scale (SUS) (n = 134) at 6 months. Adoption and sustained use were evaluated through a set of questions administered at 12 months (n = 109). Individual interviews were performed at 6 months with a sample of participants (n = 18). Quantitative data were analyzed with descriptive statistics, whereas qualitative data were analyzed using the Framework approach. RESULTS: PAI was the most successful intervention, with satisfactory usability and positive effects on motivation and behavior change, contributing to high adoption and sustained use. Online social support had a high acceptability and sustained use, but the intervention was not perceived as motivational to increase PA. Online training had low adoption, usability and sustained use. The qualitative interviews identified five main themes: (1) overall approach to physical activity, (2) motivation, (3) barriers to perform PA, (4) effects of PA, and (5) usability and acceptability of the digital interventions. CONCLUSION: Personalized digital interventions integrating behavior change techniques such as individual feedback and goal setting are more likely to increase acceptability, adoption and sustained use. Future studies should investigate which digital interventions or combinations of different interventions are more successful in promoting PA among inactive adults according to the characteristics and preferences of the users.

To demonstrate the implementation of a new anatomy segmentation, we used the model-training pipeline to generate a breast segmentation model based on a large clinical dataset. Additionally, the contour QA functionality of existing models was assessed using a retrospective cohort of 3,399 lung and 885 spine RT cases. Ambient QA was performed for various disease sites including spine RT and heart for dosimetric sparing. RESULTS: Successful training of the breast model was completed in less than a day and resulted in clinically viable whole breast contours. For the retrospective analysis, we evaluated manual-versus-AI similarity for the ten most common structures. The DL-ODA detected high similarities in heart, lung, liver, and kidney delineations but lower for esophagus, trachea, stomach, and small bowel due largely to incomplete manual contouring. The deployed Ambient QAs for heart and spine sites have prospectively processed over 2,500 cases and 230 cases over 9 months and 5 months, respectively, automatically alerting the RT personnel. DISCUSSION: The DL-ODA capabilities in providing universal AI interventions were demonstrated for On-Demand contour QA, DL segmentations, and automated model training, and confirmed successful integration of the system into a large academic radiotherapy department. The novelty of deploying the DL-ODA as a multi-modal, fully automated end-to-end AI clinical implementation solution marks a significant step towards a generalizable framework that leverages AI to improve the efficiency and reliability of RT systems.",

            "chunk": "BACKGROUND: While the link between obesity and chronic diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular disorders is well-documented, there is a growing body of evidence connecting obesity with an increased risk of cancer. However, public awareness of this connection remains limited. STUDY PURPOSE: To analyze public awareness of overweight/obesity as a risk factor for cancer and analyze public perceptions on the feasibility of ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence-based conversational agent, as an educational intervention tool. METHODS: A mixed-methods approach including deductive quantitative cross-sectional approach to draw precise conclusions based on empirical evidence on public awareness of the link between obesity and cancer; and inductive qualitative approach to interpret public perceptions on using ChatGPT for creating awareness of obesity, cancer and its risk factors was used in this study. Participants included adult residents in Saudi Arabia. A total of 486 individuals and 21 individuals were included in the survey and semi-structured interviews respectively. RESULTS: About 65% of the participants are not completely aware of cancer and its risk factors. Significant differences in awareness were observed concerning age groups (p < .0001), socio-economic status (p = .041), and regional distribution (p = .0351). A total of 10 themes were analyzed from the interview data, which included four positive factors (accessibility, personalization, cost-effectiveness, anonymity and privacy, multi-language support) and five negative factors (information inaccuracy, lack of emotional intelligence, dependency and overreliance, data privacy and security, and inability to provide physical support or diagnosis). CONCLUSION: This study has underscored the potential of leveraging ChatGPT as a valuable public awareness tool for cancer in Saudi Arabia.",

            "chunk": "Introduction Intelligence quotient (IQ) is an indicator to measure a child's cognitive ability to learn or understand and to deal with new situations with their logical and analytical skills. Children with better IQ exhibit increased cooperation when undergoing dental treatments, leading to a positive attitude toward dental care. The primary aim of the study was to assess the interrelationship between the IQ of children, space maintainer therapy, and the behavior of children aged 6-10 years. Materials and methods A total of 104 children were divided into two groups: group 1 included children undergoing space maintainer therapy and group 2 included children who did not undergo space maintainer therapy. Their IQ scores were assessed using Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices and behavior and the Frankl behavior rating scale. The data were analyzed by SPSS Version 23 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Independent t-tests were used to evaluate the differences between IQ and children with space maintainers, and Mann-Whitney U tests were used to assess the differences between behavior and space maintainers. Results The mean age of the participants was approximately 8.28 years. The mean IQ score of the group of children undergoing the space maintainer therapy was 90.69 +/- 7.65 and that of the control group was 105.59+/-10.71. Based on the Frankl behavior rating scale, the mean score in the space maintainer group was 35.44 and that of the control group was 69.56. There was a significant association between IQ, behavior, and the presence of space maintainers. Conclusion The group of children undergoing space maintainer therapy demonstrated comparatively lesser IQ, and the majority of children exhibited negative behavior. Also, children wearing space maintainers had undergone one or multiple extractions, which is traumatic for children and may lead to them likely exhibiting a negative behavior than children in the control group. Hence, it may be concluded that intelligence, behavior, and space maintainers are all significantly associated with each other.",

A neuropsychosocial approach is crucial for these patients due to associated cognitive, behavioral, and psychiatric comorbidities; however, the social cognitive domain has not been adequately addressed. METHODS: This study aimed to analyze on social cognition performance in a pediatric MD patient cohort. This cross-sectional study included 32 pediatric patients with MD and 32 matched-healthy controls. The Social Perception Domain of the NEPSY-II, the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test-Child and Happe's Strange Stories Test were administered. General intelligence and behavioral and emotional symptoms were controlled for to eliminate covariables' possible influence. The assessments were performed remotely. RESULTS: Children with MDs performed significantly worse on most of the social cognition tasks. The differences found between the groups could be explained by the level of general intelligence for some aspects more related to theory of mind (ToM) (TM NEPSY-II: F = 1.703, p = .197; Verbal task: F = 2.411, p = .125; RMET-C: F = 2.899, p = .094), but not for emotion recognition. Furthermore, these differences were also independent of behavioral and emotional symptoms. DISCUSSION: In conclusion, social cognition is apparently impaired in pediatric patients with MD, both for emotion recognition and ToM. Screening assessment in social cognition should be considered to promote early interventions aimed at improving these patient's quality of life.",

            "chunk": "INTRODUCTION: The last decade has led to rapid developments and increased usage of computational tools at the single-cell level. However, our knowledge remains limited in how extracellular cues alter quantitative macrophage morphology and how such morphological changes can be used to predict macrophage phenotype as well as cytokine content at the single-cell level. METHODS: Using an artificial intelligence (AI) based approach, this study determined whether (i) accurate macrophage classification and (ii) prediction of intracellular IL-10 at the single-cell level was possible, using only morphological features as predictors for AI. Using a quantitative panel of shape descriptors, our study assessed image-based original and synthetic single-cell data in two different datasets in which CD14+ monocyte-derived macrophages generated from human peripheral blood monocytes were initially primed with GM-CSF or M-CSF followed by polarization with specific stimuli in the presence/absence of continuous GM-CSF or M-CSF. Specifically, M0, M1 (GM-CSF-M1, TNFalpha/IFNgamma-M1, GM-CSF/TNFalpha/IFNgamma-M1) and M2 (M-CSF-M2, IL-4-M2a, M-CSF/IL-4-M2a, IL-10-M2c, M-CSF/IL-10-M2c) macrophages were examined. RESULTS: Phenotypes were confirmed by ELISA and immunostaining of CD markers. Variations of polarization techniques significantly changed multiple macrophage morphological features, demonstrating that macrophage morphology is a highly sensitive, dynamic marker of phenotype. Using original and synthetic single-cell data, cell morphology alone yielded an accuracy of 93% for the classification of 6 different human macrophage phenotypes (with continuous GM-CSF or M-CSF). A similarly high phenotype classification accuracy of 95% was reached with data generated with different stimuli (discontinuous GM-CSF or M-CSF) and measured at a different time point. These comparably high accuracies clearly validated the here chosen AI-based approach. Quantitative morphology also allowed prediction of intracellular IL-10 with 95% accuracy using only original data. DISCUSSION: Thus, image-based machine learning using morphology-based features not only (i) classified M0, M1 and M2 macrophages but also (ii) classified M2a and M2c subtypes and (iii) predicted intracellular IL-10 at the single-cell level among six phenotypes. This simple approach can be used as a general strategy not only for macrophage phenotyping but also for prediction of IL-10 content of any IL-10 producing cell, which can help improve our understanding of cytokine biology at the single-cell level.",

It was applied in different specialties with different uses, for example, in diagnosis of oral cancer, periodontal disease and dental caries, and in the treatment planning and predicting the outcome of orthognathic surgeries. The aim of this comprehensive review is to report on the application and performance of AI models designed for application in the field of endodontics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were searched to collect the most relevant articles using terms, such as AI, endodontics, and dentistry. This review included 56 papers related to AI and its application in endodontics. RESULT: The applications of AI were in detecting and diagnosing periapical lesions, assessing root fractures, working length determination, prediction for postoperative pain, studying root canal anatomy and decision-making in endodontics for retreatment. The accuracy of AI in performing these tasks can reach up to 90%. CONCLUSION: Artificial intelligence has valuable applications in the field of modern endodontics with promising results. Larger and multicenter data sets can give external validity to the AI models. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: In the field of dentistry, AI models are specifically crafted to contribute to the diagnosis of oral diseases, ranging from common issues such as dental caries to more complex conditions like periodontal diseases and oral cancer. AI models can help in diagnosis, treatment planning, and in patient management in endodontics. Along with the modern tools like cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT), AI can be a valuable aid to the clinician. How to cite this article: Ahmed ZH, Almuharib AM, Abdulkarim AA, et al.

In this study, we conducted bibliometric analysis combined with topic modeling to provide a comprehensive overview of the AI research landscape in CVD. Our analysis included 23,846 studies from Web of Science and PubMed, capturing the latest advancements and trends in this rapidly evolving field. By employing LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) we identified key research themes, trends, and collaborations within the AI-CVD domain. The findings revealed the exponential growth of AI-related research in CVD, underscoring its immense potential to revolutionize cardiovascular healthcare. The annual scientific publication of machine learning papers in CVD increases continuously and significantly since 2016, with an overall annual growth rate of 22.8%. Almost half (46.2%) of the growth happened in the last 5 years. USA, China, India, UK and Korea were the top five productive countries in number of publications. UK, Germany and Australia were the most collaborative countries with a multiple country publication (MCP) value of 42.8%, 40.3% and 40.0% respectively. We observed the emergence of twenty-two distinct research topics, including \"stroke and robotic rehabilitation therapy,\" \"robotic-assisted cardiac surgery,\" and \"cardiac image analysis,\" which persisted as major topics throughout the years. Other topics, such as \"retinal image analysis and CVD\" and \"biomarker and wearable signal analyses,\" have recently emerged as dominant areas of research in cardiovascular medicine. Convolutional neural network appears to be the most mentioned algorithm followed by LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and KNN (K-Nearest Neighbours). This indicates that the future direction of AI cardiovascular research is predominantly directing toward neural networks and image analysis. As AI continues to shape the landscape of CVD research, our study serves as a comprehensive guide for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers, providing valuable insights into the current state of AI in CVD research. This study offers a deep understanding of research trends and paves the way for future directions to maximiz the potential of AI to effectively combat cardiovascular diseases.",

It is not fully understood how such deficits emerge in the course of brain development. When considering the mechanisms of dyscalculia, two domain-specific systems are distinguished. The Approximate Number System (ANS) is related to the approximate estimation of large sets, and the Object Tracking System (OTS) is responsible for subitizing, that is, the exact quantification of small sets. In recent years, the multiple-deficit framework has become increasingly popular. On the one hand, it explains the impairment of certain general cognitive functions in children with DD, such as executive functions, attention, visual-perceptual discrimination, processing speed, and rapid scanning of visual information. On the other hand, it provides a theoretical basis for explaining the simultaneous occurrence of the different types of other comorbid conditions (such as dyslexia and ADHD) and the relationship between them. We suggest that the face recognition could be considered as another, probably impaired function in dyscalculic individuals. We highlight several brain areas involved both in numerical and facial processing: intraparietal sulcus (IPS), fusiform gyrus (FFG), and hippocampus (HC). We consider the possibility of expanding the scope of dyscalculia research by application of face perception paradigms.",

Debate continues about whether PPA is best subdivided into three variants and also regarding the most distinctive linguistic features for classifying PPA variants. In this study, we harnessed the capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) to first perform unsupervised classification of concise, connected speech samples from 78 PPA patients. Large Language Models discerned three distinct PPA clusters, with 88.5% agreement with independent clinical diagnoses. Patterns of cortical atrophy of three data-driven clusters corresponded to the localization in the clinical diagnostic criteria. We then used NLP to identify linguistic features that best dissociate the three PPA variants. Seventeen features emerged as most valuable for this purpose, including the observation that separating verbs into high and low-frequency types significantly improves classification accuracy. Using these linguistic features derived from the analysis of brief connected speech samples, we developed a classifier that achieved 97.9% accuracy in predicting PPA subtypes and healthy controls. Our findings provide pivotal insights for refining early-stage dementia diagnosis, deepening our understanding of the characteristics of these neurodegenerative phenotypes and the neurobiology of language processing, and enhancing diagnostic evaluation accuracy.",

The virus structures play a crucial role in studying their biological function and advancing the development of antiviral vaccines and treatments. Despite the effectiveness of artificial intelligence (AI) in general image processing, its development for identifying and extracting virus particles from cryo-EM micrographs (images) has been hindered by the lack of manually labelled high-quality datasets. To fill the gap, we introduce CryoVirusDB, a labeled dataset containing the coordinates of expert-picked virus particles in cryo-EM micrographs. CryoVirusDB comprises 9,941 micrographs of 9 different viruses along with the coordinates of 339,398 labeled virus particles. It can be used to train and test AI and machine learning (e.g., deep learning) methods to accurately identify virus particles in cryo-EM micrographs for building atomic 3D structural models for viruses.",

Understanding the interrelationships between system elements - humans and AI - is vital to achieving the best outcomes within individual team members' capabilities. This is also crucial in designing better AI algorithms and finding favored scenarios for joint AI-human missions that capitalize on the unique capabilities of both elements. In this conceptual study, we introduce Intentional Behavioral Synchrony (IBS) as a synchronization mechanism between humans and AI to set up a trusting relationship without compromising mission goals. IBS aims to create a sense of similarity between AI decisions and human expectations, drawing on psychological concepts that can be integrated into AI algorithms. We also discuss the potential of using multimodal fusion to set up a feedback loop between the two partners. Our aim with this work is to start a research trend centered on exploring innovative ways of deploying synchrony between teams of non-human members. Our goal is to foster a better sense of collaboration and trust between humans and AI, resulting in more effective joint missions.",

The present study performs a more specific, explainable stress classification, which could provide valuable information on the physiological stress reactions. METHODS: Physiological responses were measured in the Maastricht Acute Stress Test (MAST), comprising alternating trials of cold pressor (inducing physiological stress and pain) and mental arithmetics (eliciting cognitive and social-evaluative stress). The responses in these subtasks were compared to each other and to the baseline through mixed model analysis. Subsequently, stress type detection was conducted with a comprehensive analysis of several machine learning components affecting classification. Finally, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods were applied to analyze the influence of physiological features on model behavior. RESULTS: Most of the investigated physiological reactions were specific to the stressors, and the subtasks could be distinguished from baseline with up to 86.5% balanced accuracy. The choice of the physiological signals to measure (up to 25%-point difference in balanced accuracy) and the selection of features (up to 7%-point difference) were the two key components in classification. Reflection of the XAI analysis to mixed model results and human physiology revealed that the stress detection model concentrated on physiological features relevant for the two stressors. DISCUSSION: The findings confirm that multimodal machine learning classification can detect different types of stress reactions from baseline while focusing on physiologically sensible changes. Since the measured signals and feature selection affected classification performance the most, data analytic choices left limited input information uncompensated.",

            "chunk": "The recent shift from predominantly hardware-based systems in complex settings to systems that heavily leverage non-deterministic artificial intelligence (AI) reasoning means that typical systems engineering processes must also adapt, especially when humans are direct or indirect users. Systems with embedded AI rely on probabilistic reasoning, which can fail in unexpected ways, and any overestimation of AI capabilities can result in systems with latent functionality gaps. This is especially true when humans oversee such systems, and such oversight has the potential to be deadly, but there is little-to-no consensus on how such system should be tested to ensure they can gracefully fail. To this end, this work outlines a roadmap for emerging research areas for complex human-centric systems with embedded AI. Fourteen new functional and tasks requirement considerations are proposed that highlight the interconnectedness between uncertainty and AI, as well as the role humans might need to play in the supervision and secure operation of such systems. In addition, 11 new and modified non-functional requirements, i.e., \"ilities,\" are provided and two new \"ilities,\" auditability and passive vulnerability, are also introduced. Ten problem areas with AI test, evaluation, verification and validation are noted, along with the need to determine reasonable risk estimates and acceptable thresholds for system performance. Lastly, multidisciplinary teams are needed for the design of effective and safe systems with embedded AI, and a new AI maintenance workforce should be developed for quality assurance of both underlying data and models.",

Current methods for predicting antigen peptide immunogenicity rely primarily on simple sequence representations, which allow for some understanding of immunogenic features but provide inadequate consideration of the full scale of molecular mechanisms tied to peptide recognition. We here characterize contributions that unsupervised and supervised artificial intelligence (AI) methods can make toward understanding and predicting MHC(HLA-A2)-peptide complex immunogenicity when applied to large ensembles of molecular dynamics simulations. We first show that an unsupervised AI method allows us to identify subtle features that drive immunogenicity differences between a cancer neoantigen and its wild-type peptide counterpart. Next, we demonstrate that a supervised AI method for class I MHC(HLA-A2)-peptide complex classification significantly outperforms a sequence model on small datasets corrected for trivial sequence correlations. Furthermore, we show that both unsupervised and supervised approaches reveal determinants of immunogenicity based on time-dependent molecular fluctuations and anchor position dynamics outside the MHC binding groove. We discuss implications of these structural and dynamic immunogenicity correlates for the induction of T cell responses and therapeutic T cell receptor design.",

Recently, we have witnessed the emergence of a groundbreaking technological revolution known as artificial intelligence. Although artificial intelligence has become increasingly integrated into our daily lives, some reluctance persists among certain segments of the public. This article explores the potential of artificial intelligence as a solution to some of the main barriers encountered in the application of evidence-based practice. It highlights how artificial intelligence can assist in staying updated with the latest evidence, enhancing clinical decision-making, addressing patient misinformation, and mitigating time constraints in clinical practice. The integration of artificial intelligence into evidence-based practice has the potential to revolutionize healthcare, leading to more precise diagnoses, personalized treatment plans, and improved doctor-patient interactions. This proposed synergy between evidence-based practice and artificial intelligence may necessitate adjustments to its core concept, heralding a new era in healthcare.",

            "chunk": "BACKGROUND: Up to 15.3% of papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC) patients with negative clinical lymph node metastasis (cN0) were confirmed to have pathological lymph node metastasis in level VI. Conventional ultrasound (US) focuses on the characteristics of tumor capsule and the periphery to determine whether the tumor has invasive growth. However, due to its small size, the typical features of invasiveness shown by conventional 2-dimensional (2D) US are not well visualized. US-based radiomics makes use of artificial intelligence and big data to build a model that can help improving diagnostic accuracy and providing prognostic implication of the disease. We hope to establish and assess the value of a nomogram based on US radiomics combined with independent risk factors in predicting the invasiveness of a single PTMC without clinical lymph node metastasis (cN0). METHODS: A total of 317 patients with cN0 single PTMC who underwent US examination and operation were included in this retrospective cohort study. Patients were randomly divided into training and testing set in the ratio of 8:2. The US images of all patients were segmented, and the radiomics features were extracted. In the training dataset, the US with features of minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) were selected and radiomics signatures were then established according to their respective weighting coefficients. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were employed to generate the risk factors of possible invasive PTMC. The nomogram is then made by combining high risk factors and the radiomics signature. The efficiency of the nomogram was evaluated by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and calibration curve, and its clinical application value was assessed by decision curve analysis (DCA). The testing dataset was used to validate the model. RESULTS: In the model, seven radiomics features were selected to establish the radiomics signature. A nomogram was made by incorporating clinically independent risk factors and the radiomics signature. Both the ROC curve and calibration curve showed good prediction efficiency. The area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the nomogram in the training data were 0.76 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.71-0.82], 0.811, 0.914, and 0.727, respectively whereas the results of the testing dataset were 0.71 (95% CI: 0.58-0.84), 0.841, 0.533, and 0.868. As such, the efficacy of the nomogram in predicting the invasiveness of PTMC was subsequently validated by the DCA. CONCLUSIONS: Nomogram based on thyroid US radiomics has an excellent predictive value of the potential invasiveness of a single PTMC without clinical lymph node metastasis. With these promising results, it can potentially be the imaging marker used in daily clinical practice.",

            "chunk": "BACKGROUND: The health care system is undergoing a shift toward a more patient-centered approach for individuals with chronic and complex conditions, which presents a series of challenges, such as predicting hospital needs and optimizing resources. At the same time, the exponential increase in health data availability has made it possible to apply advanced statistics and artificial intelligence techniques to develop decision-support systems and improve resource planning, diagnosis, and patient screening. These methods are key to automating the analysis of large volumes of medical data and reducing professional workloads. OBJECTIVE: This article aims to present a machine learning model and a case study in a cohort of patients with highly complex conditions. The object was to predict mortality within the following 4 years and early mortality over 6 months following diagnosis. The method used easily accessible variables and health care resource utilization information. METHODS: A classification algorithm was selected among 6 models implemented and evaluated using a stratified cross-validation strategy with k=10 and a 70/30 train-test split. The evaluation metrics used included accuracy, recall, precision, F(1)-score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve. RESULTS: The model predicted patient death with an 87% accuracy, recall of 87%, precision of 82%, F(1)-score of 84%, and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.88 using the best model, the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) classifier. The results were worse when predicting premature deaths (following 6 months) with an 83% accuracy (recall=55%, precision=64% F(1)-score=57%, and AUC=0.88) using the Gradient Boosting (GRBoost) classifier. CONCLUSIONS: This study showcases encouraging outcomes in forecasting mortality among patients with intricate and persistent health conditions. The employed variables are conveniently accessible, and the incorporation of health care resource utilization information of the patient, which has not been employed by current state-of-the-art approaches, displays promising predictive power. The proposed prediction model is designed to efficiently identify cases that need customized care and proactively anticipate the demand for critical resources by health care providers.",

OBJECTIVE: To assess the diagnostic performance of an AI-powered dermatological algorithm called Skin Image Search on Fitzpatrick 6 skin type (dark skin) dermatological conditions. METHODS: 123 dermatological images selected from a total of 173 images were retrospectively extracted from the electronic database of a Ugandan telehealth company, The Medical Concierge Group (TMCG) after getting their consent. Details of age, gender, and dermatological clinical diagnosis were analysed using R on R studio software to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the AI app along with disease diagnosis and body part. Predictability levels of the AI app were graded on a scale of 0 to 5, where 0- no prediction was made and 1-5 demonstrated a reduction incorrect diagnosis prediction rate of the AI. RESULTS: 76 (62%) of the dermatological images were from females and 47 (38%) from males. Overall diagnostic accuracy of the AI app on black dermatological conditions was low at 17% (21 out of 123 predictable images) compared to 69.9% performance on Caucasian skin type as reported from the training results. There were varying predictability levels correctness i.e., 1-8.9%, 2-2.4%, 3-2.4%, 4-1.6%, 5-1.6% with performance along individual diagnosis highest with dermatitis (80%).

Further substrate volume reductions were identified and described involving the thalami, brainstem, hippocampi, putamina and amygdala. The combined volumes of five regions of interest (frontal pole, putamen, hippocampus, brainstem and paracentral lobule) were consistently reduced in the Rolandic basal ganglia-thalamus (RBGT) subtype. CONCLUSION: This study determined a quantifiable reduction of intracranial volume in all subtypes of HIBI and predictable selective cerebral substrate volume reduction in subtypes and subgroups. In the RBGT subtype, a key combination of five substrate injuries was consistently noted, and thalamic, occipital lobe and brainstem volume reduction was also significant when compared to the watershed subtype. CONTRIBUTION: This study demonstrates the value of integrating an artificial intelligence programme into the radiologists' armamentarium serving to quantify brain injuries more accurately in HIBI. Going forward this will be an inevitable evolution of daily radiology practice in many fields of medicine, and it would be beneficial for radiologists to embrace these technological innovations.",

In particular, the remarkable curative effect of traditional Chinese medicine during corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has attracted extensive attention globally. Medicinal plants have, therefore, become increasingly popular among the public. However, with increasing demand for and profit with medicinal plants, commercial fraudulent events such as adulteration or counterfeits sometimes occur, which poses a serious threat to the clinical outcomes and interests of consumers. With rapid advances in artificial intelligence, machine learning can be used to mine information on various medicinal plants to establish an ideal resource database. We herein present a review that mainly introduces common machine learning algorithms and discusses their application in multi-source data analysis of medicinal plants. The combination of machine learning algorithms and multi-source data analysis facilitates a comprehensive analysis and aids in the effective evaluation of the quality of medicinal plants.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods have been proposed as a way to address this shortage, by supporting providers with less extensive training as they deliver care. To this end, we developed the AI-Assisted Provider Platform (A2P2), a text-based virtual therapy interface that includes a response suggestion feature, which supports providers in delivering protocolized therapies empathetically. We studied providers with and without expertise in mental health treatment delivering a therapy session using the platform with (intervention) and without (control) AI-assistance features. Upon evaluation, the AI-assisted system significantly decreased response times by 29.34% (p=0.002), tripled empathic response accuracy (p=0.0001), and increased goal recommendation accuracy by 66.67% (p=0.001) across both user groups compared to the control.

            "chunk": "Fatty liver disease, also known as hepatic steatosis, poses a significant global health concern due to the excessive accumulation of fat within the liver. If left untreated, this condition can give rise to severe complications. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI, specifically AI-based ultrasound imaging) offer promising tools for diagnosing this condition. This review endeavors to explore the current state of research concerning AI's role in diagnosing fatty liver disease, with a particular emphasis on imaging methods. To this end, a comprehensive search was conducted across electronic databases, including Google Scholar and Embase, to identify relevant studies published between January 2010 and May 2023, with keywords such as \"fatty liver disease\" and \"artificial intelligence (AI).\" The article selection process adhered to the PRISMA framework, ultimately resulting in the inclusion of 13 studies. These studies leveraged AI-assisted ultrasound due to its accessibility and cost-effectiveness, and they hailed from diverse countries, including India, China, Singapore, the United States, Egypt, Iran, Poland, Malaysia, and Korea. These studies employed a variety of AI classifiers, such as support vector machines, convolutional neural networks, multilayer perceptron, fuzzy Sugeno, and probabilistic neural networks, all of which demonstrated a remarkable level of precision. Notably, one study even achieved a diagnostic accuracy rate of 100%, underscoring AI's potential in diagnosing fatty liver disease. Nevertheless, the review acknowledged certain limitations within the included studies, with the majority featuring relatively small sample sizes, often encompassing fewer than 100 patients. Additionally, the variability in AI algorithms and imaging techniques added complexity to the comparative analysis. In conclusion, this review emphasizes the potential of AI in enhancing the diagnosis and management of fatty liver disease through advanced imaging techniques. Future research endeavors should prioritize the execution of large-scale studies that employ standardized AI algorithms and imaging techniques to validate AI's utility in diagnosing this prevalent health condition.",

            "chunk": "BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) is a progressive condition with high global incidence. HF has two main subtypes: HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). There is an inherent need for simple yet effective electrocardiogram (ECG)-based artificial intelligence (AI; ECG-AI) models that can predict HF risk early to allow for risk modification. OBJECTIVE: The main objectives were to validate HF risk prediction models using Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) data and assess performance on HFpEF and HFrEF classification. METHODS: There were six models in comparision derived using ARIC data. 1) The ECG-AI model predicting HF risk was developed using raw 12-lead ECGs with a convolutional neural network. The clinical models from 2) ARIC (ARIC-HF) and 3) Framingham Heart Study (FHS-HF) used 9 and 8 variables, respectively. 4) Cox proportional hazards (CPH) model developed using the clinical risk factors in ARIC-HF or FHS-HF. 5) CPH model using the outcome of ECG-AI and the clinical risk factors used in CPH model (ECG-AI-Cox) and 6) A Light Gradient Boosting Machine model using 288 ECG Characteristics (ECG-Chars). All the models were validated on MESA. The performances of these models were evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and compared using the DeLong test. RESULTS: ECG-AI, ECG-Chars, and ECG-AI-Cox resulted in validation AUCs of 0.77, 0.73, and 0.84, respectively. ARIC-HF and FHS-HF yielded AUCs of 0.76 and 0.74, respectively, and CPH resulted in AUC = 0.78. ECG-AI-Cox outperformed all other models. ECG-AI-Cox provided an AUC of 0.85 for HFrEF and 0.83 for HFpEF. CONCLUSION: ECG-AI using ECGs provides better-validated predictions when compared to HF risk calculators, and the ECG feature model and also works well with HFpEF and HFrEF classification.",

Artificial intelligence-based predictive algorithms can estimate the likelihood of subscapularis tearing based on a combined analysis of these and other features. Improved outcomes should logically be expected for those shoulders with subscapularis tears that are identified and repaired.

While breast cancer disparities can partially be attributed to social determinants of health, tumor biology also contributes to survival outcomes. The rate of breast tumor growth is largely dependent on the extracellular matrix (ECM). Current research suggests the cellular components of the ECM may vary among racial and ethnic populations, and this may contribute to the incidence of cancer in African Americans. We utilized a supervised AI method to evaluate morphological differences between African American and Caucasian breast cancer tumors. Images used for analysis were downloaded from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) biorepository stored in the NIH Genomic Data Commons (GDC) data portal. We designed an ML classifier using the AlexNet model provided in PyTorch's torchvision package. The model was pre-trained and adapted via transfer learning resulting in a classification accuracy of 92.1% when using our breast cancer tumor image database split into 80% of training set and 20% of testing set. We interpreted the results of the AlexNet and ResNet50 models using LIME and saliency mapping as the explainers. Based on the images from our bi-racial testing set, this study confirmed significant variations of tumor and ECM regions in the different racial groups evaluated. Based on these findings, further analysis and characterization may provide new insight into disparities associated with the incidence of breast cancer.",

Several screening methods like endoscopy (like colonoscopy; gold standard), imaging examination [computed tomographic colonography (CTC)], guaiac-based fecal occult blood (gFOBT), immunochemical test from faeces, and stool DNA test are available with different levels of sensitivity and specificity. The available screening methods are associated with certain drawbacks like invasiveness, cost, or sensitivity.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is an enormously in-demand, cost-effective technology, that uses various tools machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) to screen, diagnose, and stage, and has great potential to treat CRC. Moreover, different ML algorithms and neural networks [artificial neural network (ANN), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and support vector machines (SVMs)] have been deployed to predict precise and personalized treatment options.

Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) Version 3.0 was used to conduct the meta-analysis. Six studies were considered in our study. The pooled mean AUC was 0.808 (95% confidence interval: 0.727, 0.890). The AUC in the included studies ranged from 0.77 to 0.91. ML models performed well, with accuracy ranging from 0.88 to 0.93 and sensitivity and specificity of 58%-78% and 88%-93%, respectively. Age, blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and blood glucose were the most significant variables required by ML models to acquire their outputs. In conclusion, AI has the potential for early prediction of CS, which may lead to a decrease in the high mortality rate associated with it. Future studies are needed to confirm the results.",

METHODS: A multicenter, historical control, observational analysis of implementation of a hemodynamic management tool within enhanced recovery pathways was conducted by identifying cardiac surgery cases from 3 sites during 2 time periods, August 1 to December 31, 2019 (preprogram), and April 1 to August 31, 2021 (program). Reoperations, emergency (salvage), or cases requiring mechanical assist were excluded. Data were extracted from electronic medical records and chart reviews. Two primary outcome variables were length of stay in the intensive care unit (using Society of Thoracic Surgeons definitions) and acute kidney injury (using modified Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes criteria). One secondary outcome variable, total initial ventilation hours, used Society of Thoracic Surgeons definitions. Differences in length of stay in the intensive care unit and total ventilation time were analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis and stepwise multiple linear regression. Acute kidney injury stage used chi-square and stepwise cumulative logistic regression. RESULTS: A total of 1404 cases (795 preprogram; 609 program) were identified. Overall reductions of 6.8 and 4.4 hours in intensive care unit length of stay (P = .08) and ventilation time (P = .03) were found, respectively. No significant association between proportion of patients identified with acute kidney injury by stage and period was found. CONCLUSIONS: Adding artificial intelligence-guided hemodynamic management to cardiac enhanced recovery pathways resulted in associated reduced time in the intensive care unit for patients undergoing nonemergency cardiac surgery across institutions in a real-world setting.",

METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in three cities of Saudi Arabia (Dammam, Riyadh, and Jeddah). A convenience sample of 450 students was incorporated using the multistage cluster sampling technique. The online survey contained three sections: students' basic data and academic achievement level, the modified Schutte self-report inventory, and the Academic Motivation Scale lowercase. RESULTS: This study revealed moderate overall scores for EI (57.1%), AM (55.6%), and grade point average (GPA) (57.6%). The overall EI score, its domains, and GPA had significant positive correlations with overall AM and intrinsic and extrinsic motivation (p < .01). Amotivation had an insignificant correlation with GPA (p < .05), but it was negatively correlated with EI and its domains (p < .01). Multiple regression analysis proved that EI domains predicted 5.0% of GPA variance; emotions appraisal and expression (beta = .02, p = .024), regulation (beta = .11, p = .032), and utilization (beta = .24, p < .01). EI domains also predicted 26.0% of AM variance; emotions appraisal and expression (beta = .11, p = .04), regulation (beta = .33, p < .01), and utilization (beta = .23, p <.01). Moreover, AM predicted 4.0% of the variance in GPA; intrinsic (beta = .25, p = .004) and extrinsic (beta = .11, p = .022) motivation. AM also predicted 25.0% of the variance in EI: intrinsic (beta = .34, p < .01) and extrinsic motivation (beta = .26, p = .026). CONCLUSION: EI and AM have a bidirectional influence on each other, significantly shaping the GPA of health sciences students in Saudi Arabia, where intrinsic motivation has a predominant role. Thus, promoting students' AM and EI is recommended to foster their academic achievement.",

However, currently, about one-third of patients are over-staged and one-third are under-staged. There is a pressing need for a more accurate staging modality to evaluate patients with bladder cancer to assist clinical decision-making. We hypothesize that MRI/RNA-seq-based radiogenomics and artificial intelligence can more accurately stage bladder cancer. A total of 40 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and matched formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues were available for analysis. Twenty-eight (28) MRI and their matched FFPE tissues were available for training analysis, and 12 matched MRI and FFPE tissues were used for validation. FFPE samples were subjected to bulk RNA-seq, followed by bioinformatics analysis. In the radiomics, several hundred image-based features from bladder tumors in MRI were extracted and analyzed. Overall, the model obtained mean sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 94%, 88%, and 92%, respectively, in differentiating intra- vs. extra-bladder cancer. The proposed model demonstrated improvement in the three matrices by 17%, 33%, and 25% and 17%, 16%, and 17% as compared to the genetic- and radiomic-based models alone, respectively. The radiogenomics of bladder cancer provides insight into discriminative features capable of more accurately staging bladder cancer. Additional studies are underway.",

In practical applications, EI faces challenges related to computational power, power consumption, size, and cost, with the primary challenge being the trade-off between computational power and power consumption. This has rendered traditional computing platforms unsustainable, making heterogeneous parallel computing platforms a crucial pathway for implementing EI. In our research, we leveraged the Xilinx Zynq 7000 heterogeneous computing platform, employed high-level synthesis (HLS) for design, and implemented two different accelerators for LeNet-5 using loop unrolling and pipelining optimization techniques. The experimental results show that when running at a clock speed of 100 MHz, the PIPELINE accelerator, compared to the UNROLL accelerator, experiences an 8.09% increase in power consumption but speeds up by 14.972 times, making the PIPELINE accelerator superior in performance. Compared to the CPU, the PIPELINE accelerator reduces power consumption by 91.37% and speeds up by 70.387 times, while compared to the GPU, it reduces power consumption by 93.35%. This study provides two different optimization schemes for edge intelligence applications through design and experimentation and demonstrates the impact of different quantization methods on FPGA resource consumption. These experimental results can provide a reference for practical applications, thereby providing a reference hardware acceleration scheme for edge intelligence applications.",

Cybercriminals inevitably adapt to new security technologies and utilize these platforms to exploit vulnerabilities for nefarious purposes, such as stealing users' sensitive and personal data. This may result in financial losses, discredit, ransomware, or the spreading of infectious malware and other catastrophic cyber-attacks. Due to the fact that ransomware encrypts user data and requests a ransom payment in exchange for the decryption key, it is one of the most devastating types of malicious software. The implications of ransomware attacks can range from a loss of essential data to a disruption of business operations and significant monetary damage. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based techniques, namely machine learning (ML), have proven to be notable in the detection of Android ransomware attacks. However, ensemble models and deep learning (DL) models have not been sufficiently explored. Therefore, in this study, we utilized ML- and DL-based techniques to build efficient, precise, and robust models for binary classification. A publicly available dataset from Kaggle consisting of 392,035 records with benign traffic and 10 different types of Android ransomware attacks was used to train and test the models. Two experiments were carried out. In experiment 1, all the features of the dataset were used. In experiment 2, only the best 19 features were used. The deployed models included a decision tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), ensemble of (DT, SVM, and KNN), feedforward neural network (FNN), and tabular attention network (TabNet). Overall, the experiments yielded excellent results. DT outperformed the others, with an accuracy of 97.24%, precision of 98.50%, and F1-score of 98.45%. Whereas, in terms of the highest recall, SVM achieved 100%. The acquired results were thoroughly discussed, in addition to addressing limitations and exploring potential directions for future work.",

            "chunk": "Underdetermined blind source separation (UBSS) has garnered significant attention in recent years due to its ability to separate source signals without prior knowledge, even when sensors are limited. To accurately estimate the mixed matrix, various clustering algorithms are typically employed to enhance the sparsity of the mixed matrix. Traditional clustering methods require prior knowledge of the number of direct signal sources, while modern artificial intelligence optimization algorithms are sensitive to outliers, which can affect accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach called the Genetic Simulated Annealing Optimization (GASA) method with Adaptive Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) clustering as initialization, named the CYYM method. This approach incorporates two key components: an Adaptive DBSCAN to discard noise points and identify the number of source signals and GASA optimization for automatic cluster center determination. GASA combines the global spatial search capabilities of a genetic algorithm (GA) with the local search abilities of a simulated annealing algorithm (SA). Signal simulations and experimental analysis of compressor fault signals demonstrate that the CYYM method can accurately calculate the mixing matrix, facilitating successful source signal recovery. Subsequently, we analyze the recovered signals using the Refined Composite Multiscale Fuzzy Entropy (RCMFE), which, in turn, enables effective compressor connecting rod fault diagnosis. This research provides a promising approach for underdetermined source separation and offers practical applications in fault diagnosis and other fields.",

            "chunk": "Digital health applications using Artificial Intelligence (AI) are a promising opportunity to address the widening gap between available resources and mental health needs globally. Increasingly, passively acquired data from wearables are augmented with carefully selected active data from depressed individuals to develop Machine Learning (ML) models of depression based on mood scores. However, most ML models are black box in nature, and hence the outputs are not explainable. Depression is also multimodal, and the reasons for depression may vary significantly between individuals. Explainable and personalised models will thus be beneficial to clinicians to determine the main features that lead to a decline in the mood state of a depressed individual, thus enabling suitable personalised therapy. This is currently lacking. Therefore, this study presents a methodology for developing personalised and accurate Deep Learning (DL)-based predictive mood models for depression, along with novel methods for identifying the key facets that lead to the exacerbation of depressive symptoms. We illustrate our approach by using an existing multimodal dataset containing longitudinal Ecological Momentary Assessments of depression, lifestyle data from wearables and neurocognitive assessments for 14 mild to moderately depressed participants over one month. We develop classification- and regression-based DL models to predict participants' current mood scores-a discrete score given to a participant based on the severity of their depressive symptoms. The models are trained inside eight different evolutionary-algorithm-based optimisation schemes that optimise the model parameters for a maximum predictive performance. A five-fold cross-validation scheme is used to verify the DL model's predictive performance against 10 classical ML-based models, with a model error as low as 6% for some participants. We use the best model from the optimisation process to extract indicators, using SHAP, ALE and Anchors from explainable AI literature to explain why certain predictions are made and how they affect mood. These feature insights can assist health professionals in incorporating personalised interventions into a depressed individual's treatment regimen.",

The fact that abundant data are a key element of a powerful prediction model is well known through various past studies. However, industrial control systems (ICS) are operated in a closed environment due to security and privacy issues, so collected data are generally not disclosed. In this environment, synthetic data generation can be a good alternative. However, ICS datasets have time-series characteristics and include features with short- and long-term temporal dependencies. In this paper, we propose the attention-based variational recurrent autoencoder (AVRAE) for generating time-series ICS data. We first extend the evidence lower bound of the variational inference to time-series data. Then, a recurrent neural-network-based autoencoder is designed to take this as the objective. AVRAE employs the attention mechanism to effectively learn the long-term and short-term temporal dependencies ICS data implies. Finally, we present an algorithm for generating synthetic ICS time-series data using learned AVRAE. In a comprehensive evaluation using the ICS dataset HAI and various performance indicators, AVRAE successfully generated visually and statistically plausible synthetic ICS data.",

            "chunk": "There is a significant risk of injury in sports and intense competition due to the demanding physical and psychological requirements. Hamstring strain injuries (HSIs) are the most prevalent type of injury among professional soccer players and are the leading cause of missed days in the sport. These injuries stem from a combination of factors, making it challenging to pinpoint the most crucial risk factors and their interactions, let alone find effective prevention strategies. Recently, there has been growing recognition of the potential of tools provided by artificial intelligence (AI). However, current studies primarily concentrate on enhancing the performance of complex machine learning models, often overlooking their explanatory capabilities. Consequently, medical teams have difficulty interpreting these models and are hesitant to trust them fully. In light of this, there is an increasing need for advanced injury detection and prediction models that can aid doctors in diagnosing or detecting injuries earlier and with greater accuracy. Accordingly, this study aims to identify the biomarkers of muscle injuries in professional soccer players through biomechanical analysis, employing several ML algorithms such as decision tree (DT) methods, discriminant methods, logistic regression, naive Bayes, support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), ensemble methods, boosted and bagged trees, artificial neural networks (ANNs), and XGBoost. In particular, XGBoost is also used to obtain the most important features. The findings highlight that the variables that most effectively differentiate the groups and could serve as reliable predictors for injury prevention are the maximum muscle strength of the hamstrings and the stiffness of the same muscle. With regard to the 35 techniques employed, a precision of up to 78% was achieved with XGBoost, indicating that by considering scientific evidence, suggestions based on various data sources, and expert opinions, it is possible to attain good precision, thus enhancing the reliability of the results for doctors and trainers. Furthermore, the obtained results strongly align with the existing literature, although further specific studies about this sport are necessary to draw a definitive conclusion.",

To address these challenges and enhance the value of MRI, radiomics and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms emerge as promising tools with a potential to impact EC risk assessment, treatment planning, and prognosis prediction. These advanced post-processing techniques allow us to quantitatively analyse medical images, providing novel insights into cancer characteristics beyond conventional qualitative image evaluation.

In particular, AI-supported solutions have been proposed in the literature to aid in the diagnosis of leprosy, and this Systematic Literature Review (SLR) aims to characterize the state of the art. This SLR followed the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) framework and was conducted in the following databases: ACM Digital Library, IEEE Digital Library, ISI Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed. Potentially relevant research articles were retrieved. The researchers applied criteria to select the studies, assess their quality, and perform the data extraction process. Moreover, 1659 studies were retrieved, of which 21 were included in the review after selection. Most of the studies used images of skin lesions, classical machine learning algorithms, and multi-class classification tasks to develop models to diagnose dermatological diseases. Most of the reviewed articles did not target leprosy as the study's primary objective but rather the classification of different skin diseases (among them, leprosy). Although AI-supported leprosy diagnosis is constantly evolving, research in this area is still in its early stage, then studies are required to make AI solutions mature enough to be transformed into clinical practice. Expanding research efforts on leprosy diagnosis, coupled with the advocacy of open science in leveraging AI for diagnostic support, can yield robust and influential outcomes.",

            "chunk": "Thyroid cancer, specifically differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC), is one of the most prevalent endocrine malignancies worldwide. Radioactive iodine therapy (RAIT) using I-131 has been a standard-of-care approach for DTC due to its ability to ablate remnant thyroid disease following surgery, thus reducing the risk of recurrence. It is also used for the treatment of iodine-avid metastases. RAIT dosimetry can be employed to determine the optimal treatment dose of I-131 to effectively treat cancer cells while safeguarding against undesirable radiation effects such as bone marrow toxicity or radiation pneumonitis. Conventional dosimetry protocols for RAIT, however, are complex and time-consuming, involving multiple days of imaging and blood sampling. This study explores the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in simplifying and optimizing RAIT. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 83 adult patients with DTC who underwent RAIT dosimetry at our institution between 1996 and 2023. The conventional MIRD-based dosimetry protocol involved imaging and blood sampling at 4, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h post-administration of a tracer activity of I-131. An AI system based on a deep-learning neural network was developed to predict the maximum permissible activity (MPA) for RAIT using only the data obtained from the initial 4, 24, and 48 h time points. The AI system predicted the MPA values with high accuracy, showing no significant difference compared to the results obtained from conventional MIRD-based analysis utilizing a paired t-test (p = 0.351, 95% CI). The developed AI system offers the potential to streamline the dosimetry process, reducing the number of imaging and blood sampling sessions while also optimizing resource allocation. Additionally, the AI approach can uncover underlying relationships in data that were previously unknown. Our findings suggest that AI-based dosimetry may be a promising method for patient-specific treatment planning in differentiated thyroid carcinoma, representing a step towards applying precision medicine for thyroid cancer. Further validation and implementation studies are warranted to assess the clinical applicability of the AI system.",

            "chunk": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrythmia and one of the strongest risk factors and causal mechanisms of ischemic stroke (IS). Acute IS due to AF tends to be more severe than with other etiology of IS and patients with treated AF have reported to experience worse outcomes after endovascular treatment compared with patients without AF. As cardioembolism accounts for more than a fifth of ISs and the risk of future stroke can be mitigated with effective anticoagulation, which has been shown to be effective and safe in patients with paroxysmal or sustained AF, the screening of patients with cryptogenic IS (CIS) for AF is paramount. Embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS) is a subtype of CIS with a high likelihood of cardioembolism. The European Stroke Organization and European Society of Cardiology guidelines recommend at least 72 h of screening when AF is suspected. The longer the screening and the earlier the time point after acute IS, the more likely the AF paroxysm is found. Several methods are available for short-term screening of AF, including in-hospital monitoring and wearable electrocardiogram recorders for home monitoring. Implantable loop monitors provide an effective long-term method to screen patients with high risk of AF after IS and artificial intelligence and convolutional neural networks may enhance the efficacy of AF screening in the future. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are preferred over vitamin K antagonists in both primary and secondary prevention of IS in AF patients. Recent data from the randomized controlled trials (RCT) also suggest that early initiation of DOAC treatment after acute IS is safe compared to later initiation. Anticoagulation treatment may still predispose for intracranial bleeding, particularly among patients with prior cerebrovascular events. Left atrial appendix closure offers an optional treatment choice for patients with prior intracranial hemorrhage and may offer an alternative to oral anticoagulation even for patients with IS, but these indications await validation in ongoing RCTs. There are still controversies related to the association of found AF paroxysms in CIS patients with prolonged screening, pertaining to the optimal duration of screening and screening strategies with prolonged monitoring techniques in patients with ESUS. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of epidemiology, screening, and prognosis in AF patients with stroke.",

            "chunk": "Access to medical imaging is pivotal in healthcare, playing a crucial role in the prevention, diagnosis, and management of diseases. However, disparities persist in this scenario, disproportionately affecting marginalized communities, racial and ethnic minorities, and individuals facing linguistic or cultural barriers. This paper critically assesses methods to mitigate these disparities, with a focus on breast cancer screening. We underscore scientific mobility as a vital tool for radiologists to advocate for healthcare policy changes: it not only enhances diversity and cultural competence within the radiology community but also fosters international cooperation and knowledge exchange among healthcare institutions. Efforts to ensure cultural competency among radiologists are discussed, including ongoing cultural education, sensitivity training, and workforce diversification. These initiatives are key to improving patient communication and reducing healthcare disparities. This paper also highlights the crucial role of policy changes and legislation in promoting equal access to essential screening services like mammography. We explore the challenges and potential of teleradiology in improving access to medical imaging in remote and underserved areas. In the era of artificial intelligence, this paper emphasizes the necessity of validating its models across a spectrum of populations to prevent bias and achieve equitable healthcare outcomes. Finally, the importance of international collaboration is illustrated, showcasing its role in sharing insights and strategies to overcome global access barriers in medical imaging. Overall, this paper offers a comprehensive overview of the challenges related to disparities in medical imaging access and proposes actionable strategies to address these challenges, aiming for equitable healthcare delivery.",

Traditional methods like immunohistochemistry or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can be challenged by artificial intelligence (AI) based on whole slide images (WSI) to predict tumor status. In this systematic review, we evaluated the role of AI in predicting MSI status, KRAS, and BRAF mutations in colorectal cancer. Studies published in PubMed up to June 2023 were included (n = 17), and we reported the risk of bias and the performance for each study. Some studies were impacted by the reduced number of slides included in the data set and the lack of external validation cohorts. Deep learning models for the d-MMR/MSI status showed a good performance in training cohorts (mean AUC = 0.89, [0.74-0.97]) but slightly less than expected in the validation cohort when available (mean AUC = 0.82, [0.63-0.98]). Contrary to the MSI status, the prediction of KRAS and BRAF mutations was less explored with a less robust methodology. The performance was lower, with a maximum of 0.77 in the training cohort, 0.58 in the validation cohort for KRAS, and 0.82 AUC in the training cohort for BRAF.",

The study was conducted to validate the performance of the two technologies in chest X-ray reading and explore their potential applications in the medical imaging diagnosis domain. The study methodology consisted of randomly selecting 2000 chest X-ray images from a single institution's patient database, and two radiologists evaluated the readings provided by KARA-CXR and ChatGPT. The study used five qualitative factors to evaluate the readings generated by each model: accuracy, false findings, location inaccuracies, count inaccuracies, and hallucinations. Statistical analysis showed that KARA-CXR achieved significantly higher diagnostic accuracy compared to ChatGPT. In the 'Acceptable' accuracy category, KARA-CXR was rated at 70.50% and 68.00% by two observers, while ChatGPT achieved 40.50% and 47.00%. Interobserver agreement was moderate for both systems, with KARA at 0.74 and GPT4 at 0.73. For 'False Findings', KARA-CXR scored 68.00% and 68.50%, while ChatGPT scored 37.00% for both observers, with high interobserver agreements of 0.96 for KARA and 0.97 for GPT4. In 'Location Inaccuracy' and 'Hallucinations', KARA-CXR outperformed ChatGPT with significant margins. KARA-CXR demonstrated a non-hallucination rate of 75%, which is significantly higher than ChatGPT's 38%. The interobserver agreement was high for KARA (0.91) and moderate to high for GPT4 (0.85) in the hallucination category. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the potential of AI and large-scale language models in medical imaging and diagnostics. It also shows that in the chest X-ray domain, KARA-CXR has relatively higher accuracy than ChatGPT.",

Due to its late presentation and poor survival rate, early diagnosis and timely treatment is of utmost importance for better clinical outcomes. Endoscopic ultrasound provides high-resolution images of the pancreas and has excellent sensitivity in the diagnosis of even small (<2 cm) pancreatic lesions. Apart from imaging, it also has an advantage of tissue acquisition (EUS fine-needle aspiration, FNA; or fine-needle biopsy, FNB) for definitive diagnoses. EUS-guided tissue acquisition plays a crucial role in genomic and molecular studies, which in today's era of personalized medicine, are likely to become important components of PDAC management. With the use of better needle designs and technical advancements, EUS has now become an indispensable tool in the management of PDAC. Lastly, artificial intelligence for the detection of pancreatic lesions and newer automated needles for tissue acquisition will obviate observer dependency in the near future, resulting in the wider dissemination and adoption of this technology for improved outcomes in patients with PDAC.",

            "chunk": "(1) Background: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a growing challenge, both for patients and physicians, in order to control the impact on health and prevent complications. Millions of patients with diabetes require medical attention, which generates problems regarding the limited time for screening but also addressability difficulties for consultation and management. As a result, screening programs for vision-threatening complications due to DM have to be more efficient in the future in order to cope with such a great healthcare burden. Diabetic macular edema (DME) is a severe complication of DM that can be prevented if it is timely screened with the help of optical coherence tomography (OCT) devices. Newly developing state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms can assist physicians in analyzing large datasets and flag potential risks. By using AI algorithms in order to process OCT images of large populations, the screening capacity and speed can be increased so that patients can be timely treated. This quick response gives the physicians a chance to intervene and prevent disability. (2) Methods: This study evaluated ConvNeXt and EfficientNet architectures in correctly identifying DME patterns on real-life OCT images for screening purposes. (3) Results: Firstly, we obtained models that differentiate between diabetic retinopathy (DR) and healthy scans with an accuracy of 0.98. Secondly, we obtained a model that can indicate the presence of edema, detachment of the subfoveolar neurosensory retina, and hyperreflective foci (HF) without using pixel level annotation. Lastly, we analyzed the extent to which the pretrained weights on natural images \"understand\" OCT scans. (4) Conclusions: Pretrained networks such as ConvNeXt or EfficientNet correctly identify features relevant to the differentiation between healthy retinas and DR, even though they were pretrained on natural images. Another important aspect of our research is that the differentiation between biomarkers and their localization can be obtained even without pixel-level annotation. The \"three biomarkers model\" is able to identify obvious subfoveal neurosensory detachments, retinal edema, and hyperreflective foci, as well as very small subfoveal detachments. In conclusion, our study points out the possible usefulness of AI-assisted diagnosis of DME for lowering healthcare costs, increasing the quality of life of patients with diabetes, and reducing the waiting time until an appropriate ophthalmological consultation and treatment can be performed.",

Encord is an easy-to-use, readily available online AI platform that was used to segment both the inner lumen and outer lumen of the PAA on DUS images. A model trained on 20 images and tested on 80 images had a mean Average Precision of 0.85 for the outer polygon and 0.23 for the inner polygon. The outer polygon had a higher recall score than precision score at 0.90 and 0.85, respectively. The inner polygon had a score of 0.25 for both precision and recall.

Effective patient-centered care requires ensuring nurses have the emotional intelligence and happiness to address the daily demands of practice. The purpose of this study is to examine the emotional intelligence and happiness among nursing students and their relationship with caring behaviors. METHODS: A cross-sectional, descriptive correlational study was conducted on nursing students (n = 363) from Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, via an online survey. Measures include demographic data survey, Oxford Happiness Questionnaire, Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire, and Caring Behaviors Inventory scale. Descriptive and multiple regression analyses were conducted for this study. RESULTS: Nursing students reported their highest degree of caring was in terms of 'respectful differences to others', while their lowest was in 'knowledge and skills'. Emotional intelligence and happiness were significant predictors of caring behaviors and explained the variance in assurance of human presence (17.5%), knowledge and skills (17.5%), respectful differences to others (18%), and positive connectedness (12.9%). In the final regression model, emotional intelligence and happiness were significant predictors of caring behaviors and explained 19.5% of the variance. CONCLUSIONS: Emotional intelligence and happiness among nursing students were found to be important factors to improve their caregiving behaviors. Therefore, nursing educators should consider integrating emotional intelligence and happiness interventions for students into their curriculum.",

A stratified data analysis was applied to compare the diagnostic effectiveness of the AI system to distinguish between the subgroups with different clinical characteristics. RESULTS: The accuracy of AI system in judging benignity and malignancy of the nodules was 75.77% (p < 0.05). We created an ROC curve by calculating the true positive rate (TPR) and the false positive rate (FPR) at different threshold values, and the AUC was 0.755. Results of the stratified analysis were as follows. (1) By nodule position: the AUC was 0.677, 0.758, 0.744, 0.982, and 0.725, respectively, for the nodules in the left upper lobe, left lower lobe, right upper lobe, right middle lobe, and right lower lobe. (2) By nodule size: the AUC was 0.778, 0.771, and 0.686, respectively, for the nodules measuring 5-10, 10-20, and 20-30 mm in diameter. (3) The predictive accuracy was higher for the subsolid pulmonary nodules than for the solid ones (80.54 vs. 66.67%). CONCLUSION: The AI system can be applied to assist in the prediction of benign and malignant pulmonary nodules. It can provide a valuable reference, especially for the diagnosis of subsolid nodules and small nodules measuring 5-10 mm in diameter.",

            "chunk": "INTRODUCTION: The development of costs-effective and sensitive screening solutions to prevent amblyopia and identify its risk factors (strabismus, refractive problems or mixed) is a significant priority of pediatric ophthalmology. The main objective of our study was to compare the classification performance of various vision screening tests, including classic, stereoacuity-based tests (Lang II, TNO, Stereo Fly, and Frisby), and non-stereoacuity-based, low-density static, dynamic, and noisy anaglyphic random dot stereograms. We determined whether the combination of non-stereoacuity-based tests integrated in the simplest artificial intelligence (AI) model could be an alternative method for vision screening. METHODS: Our study, conducted in Spain and Hungary, is a non-experimental, cross-sectional diagnostic test assessment focused on pediatric eye conditions. Using convenience sampling, we enrolled 423 children aged 3.6-14 years, diagnosed with amblyopia, strabismus, or refractive errors, and compared them to age-matched emmetropic controls. Comprehensive pediatric ophthalmologic examinations ascertained diagnoses. Participants used filter glasses for stereovision tests and red-green goggles for an AI-based test over their prescribed glasses. Sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) were our metrics, with sensitivity being the primary endpoint. AUCs were analyzed using DeLong's method, and binary classifications (pathologic vs. normal) were evaluated using McNemar's matched pair and Fisher's nonparametric tests. RESULTS: Four non-overlapping groups were studied: (1) amblyopia (n = 46), (2) amblyogenic (n = 55), (3) non-amblyogenic (n = 128), and (4) emmetropic (n = 194), and a fifth group that was a combination of the amblyopia and amblyogenic groups. Based on AUCs, the AI combination of non-stereoacuity-based tests showed significantly better performance 0.908, 95% CI: (0.829-0.958) for detecting amblyopia and its risk factors than most classical tests: Lang II: 0.704, (0.648-0.755), Stereo Fly: 0.780, (0.714-0.837), Frisby: 0.754 (0.688-0.812), p < 0.02, n = 91, DeLong's method). At the optimum ROC point, McNemar's test indicated significantly higher sensitivity in accord with AUCs. Moreover, the AI solution had significantly higher sensitivity than TNO (p = 0.046, N = 134, Fisher's test), as well, while the specificity did not differ. DISCUSSION: The combination of multiple tests utilizing anaglyphic random dot stereograms with varying parameters (density, noise, dynamism) in AI leads to the most advanced and sensitive screening test for identifying amblyopia and amblyogenic conditions compared to all the other tests studied.",

Analyzing these datasets becomes especially daunting in the presence of rare events. Machine learning (ML) methods have gained traction for analyzing rare events, yet there remains a limited exploration of bioinformatics tools that integrate ML techniques to comprehend the underlying biology. Expanding upon our previously developed computational framework of an integrative machine learning approach(1), we introduce PerSEveML, an interactive web-based that uses crowd-sourced intelligence to predict rare events and determine feature selection structures. PerSEveML provides a comprehensive overview of the integrative approach through evaluation metrics that help users understand the contribution of individual ML methods to the prediction process. Additionally, PerSEveML calculates entropy and rank scores, which visually organize input features into a persistent structure of selected, unselected, and fluctuating categories that help researchers uncover meaningful hypotheses regarding the underlying biology. We have evaluated PerSEveML on three diverse biologically complex data sets with extremely rare events from small to large scale and have demonstrated its ability to generate valid hypotheses.

Repeated machine learning using big data made various fields more predictable and accurate. In medicine, IBM Watson for Oncology (WFO), trained by Memorial Slone Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), was first introduced and applied in 14 countries worldwide.Our study was designed to assess the feasibility of WFO in actual clinical practice. We aimed to investigate the concordance rate between WFO and multidisciplinary tumor board (MTB) in Urologic cancer patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed retrospectively collected data for consecutive patients who underwent WFO and MTB simultaneously in the diagnosis of urologic malignancy before determining further treatment between August 2017 and September 2020. We compared the recommendation of the AI system, WFO (IBM Watson Health, Cambridge, MA), with the opinion of MTB for further managing all patients diagnosed with urologic malignancies such as prostate, bladder, and kidney cancer. RESULTS: A total of 55 patients were enrolled in our study. The number of patients with prostate cancer was 48. The number of bladder and kidney cancer patients was 5 and 2, respectively. The overall concordance rate between WFO and MTB was 92.7%. Three patients could not suggest proper treatment options using WFO, and the recommended choice of WFO was not feasible in the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service. CONCLUSIONS: The decision of WFO showed a high concordance rate with a multidisciplinary tumor board for urologic oncology. However, some recommendations of WFO were not feasible in actual practice, and WFO still has some points to improve and modify. Interestingly, applying WFO is likely to facilitate a multidisciplinary team approach.",

The management of breast cancer is being revolutionized by artificial intelligence (AI), which is improving early detection, pathological diagnosis, risk assessment, individualized treatment recommendations, and treatment response prediction. Nuclear medicine has used artificial intelligence (AI) for over 50 years, but more recent advances in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) have given AI in nuclear medicine additional capabilities. AI accurately analyzes breast imaging scans for early detection, minimizing false negatives while offering radiologists reliable, swift image processing assistance. It smoothly fits into radiology workflows, which may result in early treatments and reduced expenditures. In pathological diagnosis, artificial intelligence improves the quality of diagnostic data by ensuring accurate diagnoses, lowering inter-observer variability, speeding up the review process, and identifying errors or poor slides. By taking into consideration nutritional, genetic, and environmental factors, providing individualized risk assessments, and recommending more regular tests for higher-risk patients, AI aids with the risk assessment of breast cancer. The integration of clinical and genetic data into individualized treatment recommendations by AI facilitates collaborative decision-making and resource allocation optimization while also enabling patient progress monitoring, drug interaction consideration, and alignment with clinical guidelines. AI is used to analyze patient data, imaging, genomic data, and pathology reports in order to forecast how a treatment would respond. These models anticipate treatment outcomes, make sure that clinical recommendations are followed, and learn from historical data. The implementation of AI in medicine is hampered by issues with data quality, integration with healthcare IT systems, data protection, bias reduction, and ethical considerations, necessitating transparency and constant surveillance. Protecting patient privacy, resolving biases, maintaining transparency, identifying fault for mistakes, and ensuring fair access are just a few examples of ethical considerations. To preserve patient trust and address the effect on the healthcare workforce, ethical frameworks must be developed. The amazing potential of AI in the treatment of breast cancer calls for careful examination of its ethical and practical implications. We aim to review the comprehensive role of artificial intelligence in breast cancer management.",

Although data-driven algorithms have achieved some valuable results in the field of sports injury risk assessment, the lack of sufficient generalization of models and the inability to automate feature extraction have made it challenging to deploy research results in the real world. Therefore, this study attempts to build an injury risk prediction model using a combination of time-series image encoding and deep learning algorithms to address this issue better. This study used the time-series image encoding approach for feature construction to represent relationships between values at different moments, including Gramian Angular Summation Field (GASF), Gramian Angular Difference Field (GADF), Markov Transition Field (MTF), and Recurrence Plot (RP). Deep Convolutional Auto-Encoder (DCAE) learned the image-encoded data for representation to obtain features with good discrimination, and the classifier was performed using Deep Neural Network (DNN). The results from five repeated experiments show that the GASF-DCAE-DNN model is overall better in the training (AUC: 0.985 +/- 0.001, Gmean: 0.930 +/- 0.007, Sensitivity: 0.997 +/- 0.003, Specificity: 0.868 +/- 0.013) and test sets (AUC: 0.891 +/- 0.026, Gmean: 0.830 +/- 0.027, Sensitivity: 0.816 +/- 0.039, Specificity: 0.845 +/- 0.022), with good discriminative power, robustness, and generalization ability. Compared with the best model reported in the literature, the AUC, Gmean, Sensitivity, and Specificity of the GASF-DCAE-DNN model were higher by 23.9%, 27.5%, 39.7%, and 16.2%, respectively, which confirmed the validity and practicability of the model in injury risk prediction. In addition, differences in injury risk patterns between the training and test sets were identified through shapley additivity interpretation. It was also found that the training volume was an essential factor that affected injury risk prediction. The model proposed in this study provides a powerful injury risk prediction tool for future sports injury prevention practice.",

During evolution, guided by ecological interactions, natural selection, and biochemical \"intelligence\", these parasites developed admirable strategies to infect the host's organism. One of the most fascinating is represented by the nurse cell formation in muscular tissue (e.g., diaphragm, skeletal muscle, extrinsic ocular muscles, etc.). This strategy allowed the parasite to adapt and conquer the wider host species spectrum, including ungulates and humans. Consumption of undercooked meat from infected wild ungulates constitutes the most important source of infection for the human species. In this study, we show the prevalence of Trichinella spp. in hunted wild boars (Sus scrofa) in Central Italy. During the hunting season 2021/2022 in the province of Rieti, 554 wild boar diaphragm biopsies were collected for Trichinella spp. screening, in accordance with Regulation EU 1375/2015. An artificial digestion method was used for the detection of Trichinella spp. larval forms. The results revealed a positivity of 0.18% (1/554), and molecular biology identification demonstrated the presence of Trichinella britovi in the positive sample. This species is the most diffused in wild ungulate populations in Central Italy and the most frequently isolated in human patients with trichinellosis from this area, showing a close epidemiological relation between Homo sapiens and Sus scrofa for Trichinella spp. diffusion in an ecosystem. Epidemiological surveillance, in receptive animal species destined for human consumption and at any One Health level, represents the main \"winning\" strategy in the control of this worldwide, widespread foodborne parasitic disease.",

            "chunk": "INTRODUCTION: Federal agencies are increasingly expected to adopt enterprise risk management (ERM). However, public sector adoption of ERM has typically focused on the economic efficiency of tax-financed activities based on control-based practices. This reflects an emphasis on quantifiable concerns that invariably directs attention to risk, that (by definition) relates to identifiable and measurable events, thereby downplaying uncertain and unknown aspects of public exposures. This is a potentially serious shortcoming as government entities often act as society's risk managers of last resort. When extreme events happen what were previously considered private matters can quickly turn into public obligations. Hence, there is a need for proactive assessments of the evolving public risk landscape to discern unpredictable-even unknowable-developments. METHODS: The article reviews recent empirical studies on public risk management practices, effects of digitalization in public sector institutions, current strategic management research, and insights uncovered from a recent study of risk management practices in federal agencies. On this basis, the article explains how the ability to generate value from ERM can be enhanced when it intertwines with local responsive initiatives and central strategic risk analyses. It can form a dynamic adaptive risk management process where insights from dispersed actors inform updated risk analyses based on local autonomy and open exchange of information. This approach builds on specific structural features embedded in culture-driven aspirations to generate collaborative solutions. Its functional mode is an interactive control system with open discussions across levels and functions in contrast to conventional diagnostic controls that monitor predetermined key performance indicators (KPIs) and key risk indicators (KRIs). FINDINGS: Backed by theoretical rationales and empirical research evidence, it is found that applications of ERM frameworks can produce positive results but is unable to deal with a public risk landscape characterized by uncertain unpredictable conditions with potentially extreme outcome effects. It is shown how interactive exchange of fast local insights and slow integrated strategic risk analyses supported by digitized data processing can form a dynamic adaptive system that enable public sector institutions to deal with emergent high-scale exposures. It is explained how the requirement for conducive organizational structures and supportive values require a new strategic risk leadership approach, which is contrasted to observed practices in federal agencies that are constrained by prevailing public governance requirements. DISCUSSION: The need to deal with uncertainty and unknown conditions demands a cognitive shift in current thinking from a primary focus on risk to also appraise complexity and prepare for the unexpected where data-driven methods can uncover emergent exposures through dynamic information processing. This requires strategic risk leaders that recognize the significance of complex public exposures with many unknowns and a willingness to facilitate digitalized information processing rooted in a collaborative organizational climate. If handled properly, adoption of ERM in public risk management can consider emergent dimensions in complex public exposures applying interactive information processing as a dynamic adaptive risk management approach incorporating digitized methods to solicit collective intelligence for strategic risk updating.",

Predictive maintenance (PdM) emerges as a critical component, utilizing data analytic to track machine health and proactively detect machinery failures. Deep learning (DL), is pivotal in this context, offering superior accuracy in prediction through neural networks' data processing capabilities. However, DL adoption in PdM faces challenges, including continuous model updates and domain dependence. Meanwhile, centralized DL models, prevalent in PdM, pose security risks such as central points of failure and unauthorized access. To address these issues, this study presents an innovative decentralized PdM system integrating DL, blockchain, and decentralized storage based on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) for accurately predicting Remaining Useful Lifetime (RUL). DL handles predictive tasks, while blockchain secures data orchestration. Decentralized storage safeguards model metadata and training data for dynamic models. The system features synchronized two DL pipelines for time series data, encompassing prediction and training mechanisms. The detailed material and methods of this research shed light on the system's development and validation processes. Rigorous validation confirms the system's accuracy, performance, and security through an experimental testbed. The results demonstrate the system's dynamic updating and domain independence. Prediction model surpass state-of-the-art models in terms of the root mean squared error (RMSE) score. Blockchain-based scalability performance was tested based on smart contract gas usage, and the analysis shows efficient performance across varying input and output data scales. A comprehensive CIA analysis highlights the system's robust security features, addressing confidentiality, integrity, and availability aspects. The proposed decentralized predictive maintenance (PdM) system, which incorporates deep learning (DL), blockchain technology, and decentralized storage, has the potential to improve predictive accuracy and overcome significant security and scalability obstacles. Consequently, this system holds promising implications for the advancement of predictive maintenance in the context of Industry 4.0.",

This article introduces a novel fuzzy multiple criteria multiple constraint model (FMC(2)) tailored for community detection in two-mode networks, which are particularly common in dark networks. The proposed method quantitatively determines the relationships between nodes based on a probabilistic measure and uses distance metrics to identify communities within the network. Moreover, the model establishes fuzzy boundaries to differentiate between the most and least influential nodes. We validate the efficacy of FMC2 using the Noordin Terrorist dataset and conduct extensive simulations to evaluate performance metrics. The results demonstrate that FMC2 not only effectively identifies communities but also ranks influential nodes within them, contributing to a nuanced understanding of complex networks. The method promises broad applicability and adaptability, particularly in intelligence and security domains where identifying influential actors within covert networks is critical.",

            "chunk": "The primary source of energy losses in distribution networks (DNs) is rooted in line losses, which is crucial to conduct a thorough and reasonable examination of any unusual sources of line losses to guarantee the power supply in a timely and safe manner. In recent studies, identifying and analyzing abnormal line losses in DNs has been a widely and challenging research subject. This article investigates a key technology for the line loss analyses of DNs and intelligent diagnosis of abnormal causes by implementing artificial intelligence (AI), resulting in several prominent results. The proposed algorithm optimizes the parameters of the support vector machine (SVM) and suggests an intelligent diagnosis algorithm called the Improved Sparrow Search Algorithm and Support Vector Machine (ISSA-SVM). The ISSA-SVM algorithm is trained to calculate the data anomalies of line losses when changing loads and exhibiting exceptional performance to identify abnormal line losses. The accuracy of abnormality identification employing the ISSA-SVM algorithm reaches an impressive 98%, surpassing the performances of other available algorithms. Moreover, the practical performance of the proposed approach for analyzing large volumes of abnormal line loss data daily in DNs is also noteworthy. The ISSA-SVM accurately identifies the root causes of abnormal line losses and lowers the error in calculating abnormal line loss data. By combining different types of power operation data and creating a multidimensional feature traceability model, the study successfully determines the factors contributing to abnormal line losses. The relationship between transformers and voltage among various lines is determined by using the Pearson correlation, which provides valuable insights into the relationship between these variables and line losses. The algorithm's reliability and its potential to be applied to real-world scenarios bring an opportunity to improve the efficiency and safety of power supply systems. The ISSA that incorporates advanced techniques such as the Sobol sequence, golden sine algorithm, and Gaussian difference mutation appears to be a promising tool.",

In the last few decades, they have been used more and more to solve optimisation problems in the real world. Computational linguistics has its roots in linguistics, but most of the studies being done today are led by computer scientists. Data-driven and machine-learning methods have become more popular than handwritten language rules, which shows this shift. This study uses a new method called Computational Linguistics-based mood Analysis using Enhanced Beetle Antenna Search with deep learning (CLSA-EBASDL) to tackle the important problem of mood analysis during the COVID-19 pandemic. We sought to determine how people felt about the COVID-19 pandemic by studying social media texts. The method is made up of three main steps. First, data pre-processing changes raw data into a shape that can be used. After that, word embedding is done using the 'bi-directional encoder representations of transformers (BERT) process. An attention-based bidirectional long short-term memory (ABiLSTM) network is at the heart of mood classification. The Enhanced Beetle Antenna Search (EBAS) method, in particular, fine-tunes hyperparameters so that the ABiLSTM model works at its best. Many tests show that the CLSA-EBASDL method works better than others. Comparative studies show that it works, making it the best method for analysing opinion during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Federated learning (FL) has made a decentralized, cooperative AI system that can be used by many IoT apps that use AI. It is possible because it can train AI on IoT devices that are spread out and do not need to share data. FL allows local models to be trained on local data and share their knowledge to improve a global model.

Especially children with wrist fractures may benefit from machine learning (ML) solutions, since some of these lesions may be overlooked on conventional X-ray due to minimal compression without dislocation or mistaken for cartilaginous growth plates. In this article, we describe the development and optimization of AI algorithms for wrist fracture detection in children. METHODS: A team of IT-specialists, pediatric radiologists and pediatric surgeons used the freely available GRAZPEDWRI-DX dataset containing annotated pediatric trauma wrist radiographs of 6,091 patients, a total number of 10,643 studies (20,327 images). First, a basic object detection model, a You Only Look Once object detector of the seventh generation (YOLOv7) was trained and tested on these data. Then, team decisions were taken to adjust data preparation, image sizes used for training and testing, and configuration of the detection model. Furthermore, we investigated each of these models using an Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) method called Gradient Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM). This method visualizes where a model directs its attention to before classifying and regressing a certain class through saliency maps. RESULTS: Mean average precision (mAP) improved when applying optimizations pre-processing the dataset images (maximum increases of + 25.51% mAP@0.5 and + 39.78% mAP@[0.5:0.95]), as well as the object detection model itself (maximum increases of + 13.36% mAP@0.5 and + 27.01% mAP@[0.5:0.95]). Generally, when analyzing the resulting models using XAI methods, higher scoring model variations in terms of mAP paid more attention to broader regions of the image, prioritizing detection accuracy over precision compared to the less accurate models. DISCUSSION: This paper supports the implementation of ML solutions for pediatric trauma care. Optimization of a large X-ray dataset and the YOLOv7 model improve the model's ability to detect objects and provide valid diagnostic support to health care specialists. Such optimization protocols must be understood and advocated, before comparing ML performances against health care specialists.",

            "chunk": "INTRODUCTION: Depression is a leading cause of disability worldwide, affecting up to 300 million people globally. Despite its high prevalence and debilitating effects, only one-third of patients newly diagnosed with depression initiate treatment. Electronic cognitive behavioural therapy (e-CBT) is an effective treatment for depression and is a feasible solution to make mental health care more accessible. Due to its online format, e-CBT can be combined with variable therapist engagement to address different care needs. Typically, a multi-professional care team determines which combination therapy most benefits the patient. However, this process can add to the costs of these programs. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been proposed to offset these costs. METHODS: This study is a double-blinded randomized controlled trial recruiting individuals experiencing depression. The degree of care intensity a participant will receive will be randomly decided by either: (1) a machine learning algorithm, or (2) an assessment made by a group of healthcare professionals. Subsequently, participants will receive depression-specific e-CBT treatment through the secure online platform. There will be three available intensities of therapist interaction: (1) e-CBT; (2) e-CBT with a 15-20-min phone/video call; and (3) e-CBT with pharmacotherapy. This approach aims to accurately allocate care tailored to each patient's needs, allowing for more efficient use of resources. DISCUSSION: Artificial intelligence and providing patients with varying intensities of care can increase the efficiency of mental health care services. This study aims to determine a cost-effective method to decrease depressive symptoms and increase treatment adherence to online psychotherapy by allocating the correct intensity of therapist care for individuals diagnosed with depression. This will be done by comparing a decision-making machine learning algorithm to a multi-professional care team. This approach aims to accurately allocate care tailored to each patient's needs, allowing for more efficient use of resources with the convergence of technologies and healthcare. ETHICS: The study received ethics approval and began participant recruitment in December 2022. Participant recruitment has been conducted through targeted advertisements and physician referrals. Complete data collection and analysis are expected to conclude by August 2024. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.Gov, identifier NCT04747873.",

            "chunk": "In this study, a novel nonfragile deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method was proposed to realize the finite-time control of switched unmanned flight vehicles. Control accuracy, robustness, and intelligence were enhanced in the proposed control scheme by combining conventional robust control and DRL characteristics. In the proposed control strategy, the tracking controller consists of a dynamics-based controller and a learning-based controller. The conventional robust control approach for the nominal system was used for realizing a dynamics-based baseline tracking controller. The learning-based controller based on DRL was developed to compensate model uncertainties and enhance transient control accuracy. The multiple Lyapunov function approach and mode-dependent average dwell time approach were combined to analyze the finite-time stability of flight vehicles with asynchronous switching. The linear matrix inequalities technique was used to determine the solutions of dynamics-based controllers. Online optimization was formulated as a Markov decision process. The adaptive deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm was adopted to improve efficiency and convergence. In this algorithm, the actor-critic structure was used and adaptive hyperparameters were introduced. Unlike the conventional DRL algorithm, nonfragile control theory and adaptive reward function were used in the proposed algorithm to achieve excellent stability and training efficiency. We demonstrated the effectiveness of the presented algorithm through comparative simulations.",

            "chunk-id": 1,
            "chunk": "Despite substantial technical advances and wider clinical use, cochlear implant (CI) users continue to report high and elevated listening effort especially under challenging noisy conditions. Among all the objective measures to quantify listening effort, pupillometry is one of the most widely used and robust physiological measures. Previous studies with normally hearing (NH) and hearing-impaired (HI) listeners have shown that the relation between speech performance in noise and listening effort (as measured by peak pupil dilation) is not linear and exhibits an inverted-U shape. However, it is unclear whether the same psychometric relation exists in CI users, and whether individual differences in auditory sensitivity and central cognitive capacity affect this relation. Therefore, we recruited 17 post-lingually deaf CI adults to perform speech-in-noise tasks from 0 to 20 dB SNR with a 4 dB step size. Simultaneously, their pupillary responses and self-reported subjective effort were recorded. To characterize top-down and bottom-up individual variabilities, a spectro-temporal modulation task and a set of cognitive abilities were measured. Clinical word recognition in quiet and Quality of Life (QoL) were also collected. Results showed that at a group level, an inverted-U shape psychometric curve between task difficulty (SNR) and peak pupil dilation (PPD) was not observed. Individual shape of the psychometric curve was significantly associated with some individual factors: CI users with higher clinical word and speech-in-noise recognition showed a quadratic decrease of PPD over increasing SNRs; CI users with better non-verbal intelligence and lower QoL showed smaller average PPD. To summarize, individual differences in CI users had a significant impact on the psychometric relation between pupillary response and task difficulty, hence affecting the interpretation of pupillary response as listening effort (or engagement) at different task difficulty levels. Future research and clinical applications should further characterize the possible effects of individual factors (such as motivation or engagement) in modulating CI users' occurrence of 'tipping point' on their psychometric functions, and develop an individualized method for reliably quantifying listening effort using pupillometry.",

Recently, the remarkable growth of available crystal structure data and libraries of commercially available or readily synthesizable molecules have unlocked previously inaccessible regions of chemical space for drug development. Paired with improvements in virtual ligand screening methods, these expanded libraries are having a significant impact on the success of early drug design efforts. However, screening-based approaches are limited in their scalability due to computational limits and the sheer scale of drug-like space. A method within the quickly evolving field of artificial intelligence (AI), deep generative modeling, is extending the reach of molecular design beyond classical methods by learning the fundamental intra- and inter-molecular relationships in drug-target systems from existing data. In this work we introduce DrugHIVE, a deep structure-based generative model that enables fine-grained control over molecular generation. We demonstrate DrugHIVE's capacity to accelerate a wide range of common drug design tasks such as de novo generation, molecular optimization, scaffold hopping, linker design, and high throughput pattern replacement. Our method is highly scalable and can be applied to high confidence AlphaFold predicted receptors, extending our ability to generate high quality drug-like molecules to a majority of the unsolved human proteome.",

            "chunk": "Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) shocked the world with its unprecedented ability and raised significant tensions in the education field. Educators inevitably transition to an educational future that embraces GAI rather than shuns it. Understanding the mechanism between students interacting with GAI tools and their achievement is important for educators and schools, but relevant empirical evidence is relatively lacking. Due to the characteristics of personalization and real-time interactivity of GAI tools, we propose that the students-GAI interaction would affect their learning achievement through serial mediators of self-efficacy and cognitive engagement. Based on questionnaire surveys that include 389 participants as the objective, this study finds that: (1) in total, there is a significantly positive relationship between student-GAI interaction and learning achievement. (2) This positive relationship is mediated by self-efficacy, with a significant mediation effect value of 0.015. (3) Cognitive engagement also acts as a mediator in the mechanism between the student-GAI interaction and learning achievement, evidenced by a significant and relatively strong mediating effect value of 0.046. (4) Self-efficacy and cognitive engagement in series mediate this positive association, with a serial mediating effect value of 0.011, which is relatively small in comparison but also shows significance. In addition, the propensity score matching (PSM) method is applied to alleviate self-selection bias, reinforcing the validity of the results. The findings offer empirical evidence for the incorporation of GAI in teaching and learning.",

Although there is a gap in the detection rates between endoscopic BE and histological BE in current research, we trained our artificial intelligence (AI) system with images of endoscopic BE and tested the system with images of histological BE. AIM: To assess whether an AI system can aid in the detection of BE in our setting. METHODS: Endoscopic narrow-band imaging (NBI) was collected from Chung Shan Medical University Hospital and Changhua Christian Hospital, resulting in 724 cases, with 86 patients having pathological results. Three senior endoscopists, who were instructing physicians of the Digestive Endoscopy Society of Taiwan, independently annotated the images in the development set to determine whether each image was classified as an endoscopic BE. The test set consisted of 160 endoscopic images of 86 cases with histological results. RESULTS: Six pre-trained models were compared, and EfficientNetV2B2 (accuracy [ACC]: 0.8) was selected as the backbone architecture for further evaluation due to better ACC results. In the final test, the AI system correctly identified 66 of 70 cases of BE and 85 of 90 cases without BE, resulting in an ACC of 94.37%. CONCLUSION: Our AI system, which was trained by NBI of endoscopic BE, can adequately predict endoscopic images of histological BE. The ACC, sensitivity, and specificity are 94.37%, 94.29%, and 94.44%, respectively.",

            "chunk": "Purpose: This study introduces a sophisticated computational pipeline, eVir, designed for the discovery of antiviral drugs based on their interactions within the human protein network. There is a pressing need for cost-effective therapeutics for infectious diseases (e.g., COVID-19), particularly in resource-limited countries. Therefore, our team devised an Artificial Intelligence (AI) system to explore repurposing opportunities for currently used oral therapies. The eVir system operates by identifying pharmaceutical compounds that mirror the effects of antiviral peptides (AVPs)-fragments of human proteins known to interfere with fundamental phases of the viral life cycle: entry, fusion, and replication. eVir extrapolates the probable antiviral efficacy of a given compound by analyzing its established and predicted impacts on the human protein-protein interaction network. This innovative approach provides a promising platform for drug repurposing against SARS-CoV-2 or any virus for which peptide data is available. Methods: The eVir AI software pipeline processes drug-protein and protein-protein interaction networks generated from open-source datasets. eVir uses Node2Vec, a graph embedding technique, to understand the nuanced connections among drugs and proteins. The embeddings are input a Siamese Network (SNet) and MLPs, each tailored for the specific mechanisms of entry, fusion, and replication, to evaluate the similarity between drugs and AVPs. Scores generated from the SNet and MLPs undergo a Platt probability calibration and are combined into a unified score that gauges the potential antiviral efficacy of a drug. This integrated approach seeks to boost drug identification confidence, offering a potential solution for detecting therapeutic candidates with pronounced antiviral potency. Once identified a number of compounds were tested for efficacy and toxicity in lung carcinoma cells (Calu-3) infected with SARS-CoV-2. A lead compound was further identified to determine its efficacy and toxicity in K18-hACE2 mice infected with SARS-CoV-2. Computational Predictions: The SNet confidently differentiated between similar and dissimilar drug pairs with an accuracy of 97.28% and AUC of 99.47%. Key compounds identified through these networks included Zinc, Mebendazole, Levomenol, Gefitinib, Niclosamide, and Imatinib. Notably, Mebendazole and Zinc showcased the highest similarity scores, while Imatinib, Levemenol, and Gefitinib also ranked within the top 20, suggesting their significant pharmacological potentials. Further examination of protein binding analysis using explainable AI focused on reverse engineering the causality of the networks. Protein interaction scores for Mebendazole and Imatinib revealed their effects on notable proteins such as CDPK1, VEGF2, ABL1, and several tyrosine protein kinases. Laboratory Studies: This study determined that Mebendazole, Gefitinib, Topotecan and to some extent Carfilzomib showed conventional drug-response curves, with IC50 values near or below that of Remdesivir with excellent confidence all above R2>0.91, and no cytotoxicity at the IC50 concentration in Calu-3 cells. Cyclosporine A showed antiviral activity, but also unconventional drug-response curves and low R2 which are explained by the non-dose dependent toxicity of the compound. Additionally, Niclosamide demonstrated a conventional drug-response curve with high confidence; however, its inherent cytotoxicity may be a confounding element that misrepresents true antiviral efficacy, by reflecting cellular damage rather than a genuine antiviral action. Remdesivir was used as a control compound and was evaluated in parallel with the submitted test article and had conventional drug-response curves validating the overall results of the assay. Mebendazole was identified from the cell studies to have efficacy at non-toxic concentrations and were further evaluated in mice infected with SARS-CoV-2. Mebendazole administered to K18-hACE2 mice infected with SARS-CoV-2, resulted in a 44.2% reduction in lung viral load compared to non-treated placebo control respectively. There were no significant differences in body weight and all clinical chemistry determinations evaluated (i.e., kidney and liver enzymes) between the different treatment groups. Conclusion: This research underscores the potential of repurposing existing compounds for treating COVID-19. Our preliminary findings underscore the therapeutic promise of several compounds, notably Mebendazole, in both in vitro and in vivo settings against SARS-CoV-2. Several of the drugs explored, especially Mebendazole, are off-label medication; their cost-effectiveness position them as economical therapies against SARS-CoV-2.",

Future studies using this tool may benefit from targeting those outcomes that are more relevant to clinicians and most achievable. Methods A three-round Delphi study was conducted with a panel of 10 critical care physicians and three nurses in the United States to identify outcomes that may be most relevant and achievable with the HSI when evaluated for use in the ICU. To achieve criteria for relevance, at least 65% of panelists had to rate an outcome as a 4 or 5 on a 5-point scale. Results Nineteen of 24 outcomes that may be associated with the HSI achieved consensus for relevance. The Kemeny-Young approach was used to develop a matrix depicting the distribution of outcomes considering both relevance and achievability. \"Reduces time spent in hemodynamic instability\" and \"reduces times to recognition of hemodynamic instability\" were the highest-ranking outcomes considering both relevance and achievability. Conclusion This Delphi study was a feasible method to identify relevant outcomes that may be associated with an appropriate predictive analytic tool in the ICU. These findings can provide insight to researchers looking to study such tools to impact outcomes relevant to critical care practitioners. Future studies should test these tools in the ICU that target the most clinically relevant and achievable outcomes, such as time spent hemodynamically unstable or time until actionable nursing assessment or treatment.",

            "chunk": "BACKGROUND: T-wave alternans (TWA) analysis was shown in >14,000 individuals studied worldwide over the past two decades to be a useful tool to assess risk for cardiovascular mortality and sudden arrhythmic death. TWA analysis by the modified moving average (MMA) method is FDA-cleared and CMS-reimbursed (CAG-00293R2). OBJECTIVE: Because the MMA technique is inherently suitable for dynamic tracking of alternans levels, it was selected for development of artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled algorithms using convolutional neural networks (CNN) to achieve rapid, efficient, and accurate assessment of P-wave alternans (PWA), R-wave alternans (RWA), and TWA. METHODS: The novel application of CNN algorithms to enhance MMA analysis generated efficient and powerful pattern-recognition algorithms for highly accurate alternans quantification. Algorithm reliability and accuracy were verified using simulated ECGs achieving R(2) >/= 0.99 (p < 0.01) in response to noise inputs and artifacts that emulate real-life conditions. RESULTS: Accuracy of the new AI-MMA algorithms in TWA analysis (n = 5) was significantly improved over unsupervised, automated MMA output (p = 0.036) and did not differ from conventional MMA analysis with expert overreading (p = 0.21). Accuracy of AI-MMA in PWA analysis (n = 45) was significantly improved over unsupervised, automated MMA output (p < 0.005) and did not differ from conventional MMA analysis with expert overreading (p = 0.89). TWA and PWA by AI-MMA were correlated with conventional MMA output over-read by an expert reader (R(2) = 0.7765, R(2) = 0.9504, respectively). CONCLUSION: This novel technique for AI-MMA analysis could be suitable for use in diverse in-hospital and out-of-hospital monitoring systems, including cardiac implantable electronic devices and smartwatches, for tracking atrial and ventricular arrhythmia risk.",

METHODS: 35 questions from real-life case scenarios, clinical consultations, and clinical chemistry testing questions were used to evaluate ChatGPT 3.5, and GPT-4 alongside clinical chemistry trainees (residents/fellows) and clinical chemistry faculty. The responses were scored based on category and based on years of experience. RESULTS: The Senior Chemistry Faculty demonstrated superior accuracy with 100% of correct responses compared to 90.5%, 82.9%, and 71.4% of correct responses from the junior chemistry faculty, fellows, and residents respectively. They all outperformed both ChatGPT 3.5 and GPT-4 which generated 60% and 71.4% correct responses respectively. Of the sub-categories examined, ChatGPT 3.5 achieved 100% accuracy in endocrinology while GPT-4 did not achieve 100% accuracy in any subcategory. GPT-4 was overall better than ChatGPT 3.5 by generating similar correct responses as residents (71.4%) but performed poorly to human participants when both partially correct and incorrect indices were considered. CONCLUSION: Despite all the advances in AI-powered language models, ChatGPT 3.5 and GPT-4 cannot replace a trained pathologist in answering clinical chemistry questions. Caution should be observed by people, especially those not trained in clinical chemistry, to interpret test results using chatbots.",

We aim to propose clear positions to scientific societies, institutions, pathologists, and oncologists to guide and shape the appropriate diagnostic strategies for HER2-low breast cancer. The fundamental question at hand is whether the necessary tools to effectively translate our knowledge about HER2 into practical diagnostic schemes for the lower spectrum of expression are available. Our investigation is centered on the significance of distinguishing between an immunohistochemistry (IHC) score 0 and score 1+ in light of the clinical implications now apparent, as patients with HER2-low breast cancer become eligible for trastuzumab-deruxtecan treatment. Furthermore, we discuss the definition of HER2-low beyond its conventional boundaries and assess the reliability of established diagnostic procedures designed at a time when therapeutic perspectives were non-existent for these cases. In this regard, we examine potential complementary technologies, such as gene expression analysis and liquid biopsy. Ultimately, we consider the potential role of artificial intelligence (AI) in the field of digital pathology and its integration into HER2 testing, with a particular emphasis on its application in the context of HER2-low breast cancer.",

In recent years, microbiological analysis in forensic science has emerged as a cutting-edge technology. It not only exhibits individual specificity, distinguishing different human biotraces from various sites of occurrence (e.g., gastrointestinal, oral, skin, respiratory, and genitourinary tracts), each hosting distinct bacterial species, but also offers insights into the accident's location and the surrounding environment. The integration of machine learning with microbiomics provides a substantial improvement in classifying bacterial species compares to traditional sequencing techniques. This review discusses the use of machine learning algorithms such as RF, SVM, ANN, DNN, regression, and BN for the detection and identification of various bacteria, including Bacillus anthracis, Acetobacter aceti, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus, among others. Deep leaning techniques, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) models and derivatives, are also employed to predict the victim's age, gender, lifestyle, and racial characteristics. It is anticipated that big data analytics and artificial intelligence will play a pivotal role in advancing forensic microbiology in the future.",

We purposed to identify the underlying causative genetic factors of three individuals in each Chinese family who presented with symptoms of intellectual disability and facial dysmorphic features. We provided prenatal diagnosis for the three families and genetic counseling for the prevention of this disease. Methods: We collected retrospective clinical diagnostic evidence for the three probands in our study, which included magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computerized tomography (CT), electroencephalogram (EEG), and intelligence tests for the three probands in our study. Genetic investigation of the probands and their next of kin was performed by Trio-whole exome sequencing (WES). Sanger sequencing or quantitative PCR technologies were then used as the next step to verify the variants confirmed with Trio-WES for the three families. Moreover, we performed amniocentesis to explore the state of the three pathogenic variants in the fetuses by prenatal molecular genetic diagnosis at an appropriate gestational period for the three families. Results: The three probands and one fetus were clinically diagnosed with microcephaly and exhibited intellectual developmental disability, postnatal feeding difficulties, and facial dysmorphic features. Combining probands' clinical manifestations, Trio-WES uncovered the three heterozygous variants in DYRK1A: a novel variant exon3_exon4del p.(Gly4_Asn109del), a novel variant c.1159C>T p.(Gln387*), and a previously presented but rare pathogenic variant c.1309C>T p.(Arg437*) (NM_001396.5) in three families, respectively. In light of the updated American College of Medical Genetic and Genomics (ACMG) criterion, the variant of exon3_exon4del and c.1159C>T were both classified as likely pathogenic (PSV1+PM6), while c1309C>T was identified as pathogenic (PVS1+PS2_Moderate+PM2). Considering clinical features and molecular testimony, the three probands were confirmed diagnosed with MRD7. These three discovered variants were considered as the three causal mutations for MRD7. Prenatal diagnosis detected the heterozygous dominant variant of c.1159C>T p.(Gln387*) in one of the fetuses, indicating a significant probability of MRD7, subsequently the gestation was intervened by the parents' determination and professional obstetrical operation. On the other side, prenatal molecular genetic testing revealed wild-type alleles in the other two fetuses, and their parents both decided to sustain the gestation. Conclusion: We identified two novel and one rare mutation in DYRK1A which has broadened the spectrum of DYRK1A and provided evidence for the diagnosis of MRD7 at the molecular level. Besides, this study has supported the three families with MRD7 to determine the causative genetic factors efficiently and provide concise genetic counseling for the three families by using Trio-WES technology.",

However, the undifferentiated or anaplastic type accounting for < 0.2%, usually in elderly individuals, exhibits a dismal prognosis with rapid growth and disappointing outcomes. It is the most aggressive form of thyroid carcinoma, with a median survival of 5 mo and poor quality of life (airway obstruction, dysphagia, hoarseness, persistent pain). Early diagnosis and staging are crucial. Diagnostic tools include biopsy (fine needle aspiration, core needle, open surgery), high-resolution ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, [(18)F]fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomo-graphy/computed tomography, liquid biopsy and microRNAs. The BRAF gene (BRAF-V600E and BRAF wild type) is the most often found molecular factor. Others include the genes RET, KRAS, HRAS, and NRAS. Recent management policy is based on surgery, even debulking, chemotherapy (cisplatin or doxorubicin), radiotherapy (adjuvant or definitive), targeted biological agents and immunotherapy. The last two options constitute novel hopeful management modalities improving the overall survival in these otherwise condemned patients. Anti-programmed death-ligand 1 antibody immunotherapy, stem cell targeted therapies, nanotechnology achievements and artificial intelligence imple-mentation provide novel promising alternatives. Genetic mutations determine molecular pathways, thus indicating novel treatment strategies such as anti-BRAF, anti-vascular endothelial growth factor-A, and anti-epidermal growth factor receptor. Treatment with the combination of the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib and the MEK inhibitor trametinib has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration in cases with BRAF-V600E gene mutations and is currently the standard care. This neoadjuvant treatment followed by surgery ensures a two-year overall survival of 80%. Prognostic factors for improved outcomes have been found to be younger age, earlier tumor stage and radiation therapy. A multidisciplinary approach is necessary, and the therapeutic plan should be individualized based on surveillance and epidemiology end results.",

They serve various purposes, including determining age, analyzing patterns of tooth eruption/shedding, and treatment planning and prognosis. The emergence of digital radiography technology has piqued interest in using artificial intelligence systems to assist and guide dental professionals. These cutting-edge technologies assist in streamlining decision-making processes by enabling entity classification and localization tasks. With the integration of artificial Intelligence algorithms tailored for pediatric dentistry applications and utilizing automated tools, there is an optimistic outlook on improving diagnostic capabilities while reducing stress and fatigue among clinicians. METHODOLOGY: The dataset comprised 620 images (mixed dentition: 314, permanent dentition: 306). Panoramic radiographs taken were within the age range of 4-16 years. The classification of deciduous and permanent teeth involved training CNN-based models using different architectures such as Resnet, AlexNet, and EfficientNet, among others. A ratio of 70:15:15 was utilized for training, validation, and testing, respectively. RESULT AND CONCLUSION: The findings indicated that among the models proposed, EfficientNetB0 and EfficientNetB3 exhibited superior performance. Both EfficientNetB0 and EfficientNetB3 achieved an accuracy rate, precision, recall, and F1 scores of 98% in classifying teeth as either deciduous or permanent. This implies that these models were highly accurate in identifying patterns/features within the dataset used for evaluation.",

METHODS: In this study, we measured the thickness of the RNFL, GCL, IPL, and choroidal thickness using a spectral optical coherence tomography (OCT) device and we compared the results between the children diagnosed with ASD and healthy controls. Correlation between the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) and the OCT data was evaluated. RESULTS: Both ASD and control group consisted of 40 subjects (30 males and 10 females). Of the children in the ASD group, 29 had normal intelligence and 11 had mild intellectual disability (MID). The mean age of patients in the ASD group and control groups were 9.77 +/- 3.37 years and 9.85 +/- 3.97 years (p = 0.928). There was a statistically significant difference between the ASD group and the control group in the nasal and nasal-superior sectors of the RNFL layers in the left eye when all the lower layers of RNFL were assessed. In both eyes, the children with ASD had considerably lower mean choroidal thicknesses than the controls. When compared to the controls, the GCL and IPL volumes in the individuals with ASD were considerably lower in both eyes. Compared to the MID group, the left GCL volume of the nasal-inferior group was noticeably higher. A significant correlation was found between CARS scores and left GCL left IPL. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to RNFL in the ASD group, significant reductions in IPL, GCL, and choroidal thickness were observed in both eyes. It is thought that GCL may be a much more important biomarker than RNFL in terms of representing the structural deterioration in the brain. In addition, these results may form the basis for a new perspective on the use of OCT for the diagnosis and clinical course of autism.",

Second-observer is the most effective technique for reducing these events and can be economically implemented with the advent of artificial intelligence (AI). AIM: To achieve appropriate AI model training, a large annotated dataset is necessary to train the AI models. Our goal in this research is to compare two methods for decreasing the annotation time to establish ground truth: Skip-slice annotation and AI-initiated annotation. METHODS: We developed a 2D U-Net as an AI second observer for detecting colorectal cancer (CRC) and an ensemble of 5 differently initiated 2D U-Net for ensemble technique. Each model was trained with 51 cases of annotated CRC computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis, tested with 7 cases, and validated with 20 cases from The Cancer Imaging Archive cases. The sensitivity, false positives per case, and estimated Dice coefficient were obtained for each method of training. We compared the two methods of annotations and the time reduction associated with the technique. The time differences were tested using Friedman's two-way analysis of variance. RESULTS: Sparse annotation significantly reduces the time for annotation particularly skipping 2 slices at a time (P < 0.001). Reduction of up to 2/3 of the annotation does not reduce AI model sensitivity or false positives per case. Although initializing human annotation with AI reduces the annotation time, the reduction is minimal, even when using an ensemble AI to decrease false positives. CONCLUSION: Our data support the sparse annotation technique as an efficient technique for reducing the time needed to establish the ground truth.",

Recent years have seen a rapid increase in radiomics applications in nuclear medicine, leading to some promising research results in digestive system oncology, which have been driven by big data analysis and the development of artificial intelligence. Although radiomics advances one step further toward the non-invasive precision medical analysis, it is still a step away from clinical application and faces many challenges. This review article summarizes the available literature on digestive system tumors regarding radiomics in nuclear medicine. First, we describe the workflow and steps involved in radiomics analysis. Subsequently, we discuss the progress in clinical application regarding the utilization of radiomics for distinguishing between various diseases and evaluating their prognosis, and demonstrate how radiomics advances this field. Finally, we offer our viewpoint on how the field can progress by addressing the challenges facing clinical implementation.",

The aim of the article was to show how self-esteem, emotional intelligence and social competences explain the sense of quality of life in a group of illusionists (N = 53). PARTICIPANTS AND PROCEDURE: The aim of the article was to show how self-esteem, emotional intelligence and social competences explain the sense of quality of life in a group of illusionists (N = 53). Moreover, the moderating role of the stage experience of relationships between predictors and the explained variable was checked. Polish tools were used in the study: the Popular Questionnaire of Emotional Intelligence, the Questionnaire of Social Competences and the Sense of Quality of Life Questionnaire. RESULTS: Among the predictors that explained the sense of quality of life to the greatest extent (in the psychosocial, subjective and metaphysical spheres) were the acceptance of emotions and social competences. Stage experience turned out to be a moderator of the relation between emotional intelligence and the subjective sphere of the sense of quality of life.

Strong coupling has been widely demonstrated in many configurations at different ambient conditions to date and may serve as a promising tool to modulate THz microcavities. Here, we schematically design a microcavity-plasmon hybrid system, and propose an effective approach to modulating the resonant frequencies of THz microcavities by the microcavity-resonator strong coupling. In this case, we observed the strongly coupling states, where the resultant two-polariton branches exhibit an anti-crossing splitting in the frequency domain, experimentally exhibiting a  approximately 6.2% frequency modulation to the microcavity compared to the uncoupled case. This work provides an efficient approach to modulating chip-scale THz microcavities, thereby facilitating the development and application of compact THz integrated devices, further empowering the evolution of future information processing and intelligent computing system.",

Despite the convenience brought by geographic information systems and computer-aided design, determining the layout of land use and roads still heavily relies on human experts. Here we propose an artificial intelligence urban-planning model to generate spatial plans for urban communities. To overcome the difficulty of diverse and irregular urban geography, we construct a graph to describe the topology of cities in arbitrary forms and formulate urban planning as a sequential decision-making problem on the graph. To tackle the challenge of the vast solution space, we develop a reinforcement learning model based on graph neural networks. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world communities demonstrate that our computational model outperforms plans designed by human experts in objective metrics and that it can generate spatial plans responding to different circumstances and needs. We also propose a human-artificial intelligence collaborative workflow of urban planning, in which human designers can substantially benefit from our model to be more productive, generating more efficient spatial plans with much less time. Our method demonstrates the great potential of computational urban planning and paves the way for more explorations in leveraging computational methodologies to solve challenging real-world problems in urban science.",

AI encompasses several modalities, including artificial neural networks (ANNs), referring to computer models partly based on the workings of the brain. ANNs have existed since the &rsquo;50s, but only became &lsquo;mainstream&rsquo; since the 2010s. The fact that they are inspired by the workings of the brain raises the question of whether they can also be used to model the (dys)functioning of the brain. This question led to the advent of the research field &lsquo;computational psychiatry&rsquo;. AIM: This article aims at providing an accessible introduction to artificial neural networks, and potential applications hereof in contemporary psychiatric practice. METHOD: Literature review with some examples. RESULTS: In this article we try to outline with some concrete examples what artificial neural networks are and how they can be used to model mechanisms in the brain. We successively discuss ANNs as a model of the human visual system, as a model of prosopagnosia and as a model of auditory hallucinations and finally as a model of autism spectrum disorder. We also describe a number of limitations of this approach. CONCLUSION: A computer model that models the entire brain is challenging at present, but current models can help in testing hypotheses concerning possible mechanisms that give rise to a wide range of neuropsychiatric conditions.",

METHODS: This review was performed according to the 2020 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement (PRISMA). We quantify the diagnostic accuracy of AI models in the field of TED assessment and appraise the quality of these studies using the modified QUADAS-2 tool. RESULTS: A total of 13 studies were included in this review. The most common AI models used in these studies are convolutional neural networks (CNN). The majority of the studies compared algorithm performance against healthcare professionals. The overall risk of bias and applicability using the modified Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2) tool led to most of the studies being classified as low risk, although higher deficiency was noted in the risk of bias in flow and timing. CONCLUSIONS: While the results of the review showed high diagnostic accuracy of the AI models in identifying features of TED relevant to disease assessment, deficiencies in study design causing study bias and compromising study applicability were noted.

Living-donor liver transplantation (LDLT) has emerged as a viable option, expanding the donor pool and enabling timely transplantation with favorable graft function and improved long-term outcomes. An accurate evaluation of the donor liver's volumetry (LV) and anatomical study is crucial to ensure adequate future liver remnant, graft volume and precise liver resection. Thus, ensuring donor safety and an appropriate graft-to-recipient weight ratio. Manual LV (MLV) using computed tomography has traditionally been considered the gold standard for assessing liver volume. However, the method has been limited by cost, subjectivity, and variability. Automated LV techniques employing advanced segmentation algorithms offer improved reproducibility, reduced variability, and enhanced efficiency compared to manual measurements. However, the accuracy of automated LV requires further investigation. The study provides a comprehensive review of traditional and emerging LV methods, including semi-automated image processing, automated LV techniques, and machine learning-based approaches. Additionally, the study discusses the respective strengths and weaknesses of each of the aforementioned techniques. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, including machine learning and deep learning, is expected to become a routine part of surgical planning in the near future. The implementation of AI is expected to enable faster and more accurate image study interpretations, improve workflow efficiency, and enhance the safety, speed, and cost-effectiveness of the procedures. Accurate preoperative assessment of the liver plays a crucial role in ensuring safe donor selection and improved outcomes in LDLT. MLV has inherent limitations that have led to the adoption of semi-automated and automated software solutions. Moreover, AI has tremendous potential for LV and segmentation; however, its widespread use is hindered by cost and availability. Therefore, the integration of multiple specialties is necessary to embrace technology and explore its possibilities, ranging from patient counseling to intraoperative decision-making through automation and AI.",

            "chunk": "PURPOSE: The objective of this scoping review was to investigate the applicability and performance of various convolutional neural network (CNN) models in tooth numbering on panoramic radiographs, achieved through classification, detection, and segmentation tasks. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An online search was performed of the PubMed, Science Direct, and Scopus databases. Based on the selection process, 12 studies were included in this review. RESULTS: Eleven studies utilized a CNN model for detection tasks, 5 for classification tasks, and 3 for segmentation tasks in the context of tooth numbering on panoramic radiographs. Most of these studies revealed high performance of various CNN models in automating tooth numbering. However, several studies also highlighted limitations of CNNs, such as the presence of false positives and false negatives in identifying decayed teeth, teeth with crown prosthetics, teeth adjacent to edentulous areas, dental implants, root remnants, wisdom teeth, and root canal-treated teeth. These limitations can be overcome by ensuring both the quality and quantity of datasets, as well as optimizing the CNN architecture. CONCLUSION: CNNs have demonstrated high performance in automated tooth numbering on panoramic radiographs. Future development of CNN-based models for this purpose should also consider different stages of dentition, such as the primary and mixed dentition stages, as well as the presence of various tooth conditions. Ultimately, an optimized CNN architecture can serve as the foundation for an automated tooth numbering system and for further artificial intelligence research on panoramic radiographs for a variety of purposes.",

            "chunk": "OBJECTIVE: At the forefront of machine learning research since its inception has been natural language processing, also known as text mining, referring to a wide range of statistical processes for analyzing textual data and retrieving information. In medical fields, text mining has made valuable contributions in unexpected ways, not least by synthesizing data from disparate biomedical studies. This rapid scoping review examines how machine learning methods for text mining can be implemented at the intersection of these disparate fields to improve the workflow and process of conducting systematic reviews in medical research and related academic disciplines. METHODS: The primary research question that this investigation asked, \"what impact does the use of machine learning have on the methods used by systematic review teams to carry out the systematic review process, such as the precision of search strategies, unbiased article selection or data abstraction and/or analysis for systematic reviews and other comprehensive review types of similar methodology?\" A literature search was conducted by a medical librarian utilizing multiple databases, a grey literature search and handsearching of the literature. The search was completed on December 4, 2020. Handsearching was done on an ongoing basis with an end date of April 14, 2023. RESULTS: The search yielded 23,190 studies after duplicates were removed. As a result, 117 studies (1.70%) met eligibility criteria for inclusion in this rapid scoping review. CONCLUSIONS: There are several techniques and/or types of machine learning methods in development or that have already been fully developed to assist with the systematic review stages. Combined with human intelligence, these machine learning methods and tools provide promise for making the systematic review process more efficient, saving valuable time for systematic review authors, and increasing the speed in which evidence can be created and placed in the hands of decision makers and the public.",

Since magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the wrist and hand, in case of RA and MRI of the sacroiliac joints (SIJ) in case of axSpA can identify inflammation before it is clinically discernible, this modality may be crucial for early diagnosis. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, together with machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) have quickly evolved in the medical field, having an important role in improving diagnosis, prognosis, in evaluating the effectiveness of treatment and monitoring the activity of rheumatic diseases through MRI. The improvements of AI techniques in the last years regarding imaging interpretation have demonstrated that a computer-based analysis can equal and even exceed the human eye. The studies in the field of AI have investigated how specific algorithms could distinguish between tissues, diagnose rheumatic pathology and grade different signs of early inflammation, all of them being crucial for tracking disease activity.

            "chunk": "Exploring microbial stress responses to drugs is crucial for the advancement of new therapeutic methods. While current artificial intelligence methodologies have expedited our understanding of potential microbial responses to drugs, the models are constrained by the imprecise representation of microbes and drugs. To this end, we combine deep autoencoder and subgraph augmentation technology for the first time to propose a model called JDASA-MRD, which can identify the potential indistinguishable responses of microbes to drugs. In the JDASA-MRD model, we begin by feeding the established similarity matrices of microbe and drug into the deep autoencoder, enabling to extract robust initial features of both microbes and drugs. Subsequently, we employ the MinHash and HyperLogLog algorithms to account intersections and cardinality data between microbe and drug subgraphs, thus deeply extracting the multi-hop neighborhood information of nodes. Finally, by integrating the initial node features with subgraph topological information, we leverage graph neural network technology to predict the microbes' responses to drugs, offering a more effective solution to the 'over-smoothing' challenge. Comparative analyses on multiple public datasets confirm that the JDASA-MRD model's performance surpasses that of current state-of-the-art models. This research aims to offer a more profound insight into the adaptability of microbes to drugs and to furnish pivotal guidance for drug treatment strategies.

            "chunk": "AIM: A high level of directly measured small dense low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (sdLDL-C) is a strong risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. A method for estimating sdLDL-C by using Sampson's equation that includes levels of total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), non-HDL-C and triglycerides (TG) has recently been proposed. We investigated the validation and exploration of estimated sdLDL-C level. METHODS: The associations between measured and estimated sdLDL-C levels were investigated in 605 Japanese subjects (men/women: 280/325; mean age: 65+/-15 years) who received annual health check-ups in the Tanno Sobetsu Study, a population-based cohort. RESULTS: Estimated sdLDL-C level was highly correlated with measured sdLDL-C level in all subjects (R(2) =0.701), nondiabetic subjects without any medication (n=254, R (2)=0.686) and subjects with diabetes mellitus (n=128, R(2)=0.721). Multivariable regression analysis showed that levels of non-HDL-C, TG and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (gammaGTP) were independent predictors of measured sdLDL-C level. In a stratification of the LDL window, all of the subjects with a combination of high non-HDL-C (>/= 170 mg/dL) and high TG (>/= 150 mg/dL) had high levels of measured and estimated sdLDL-C (>/= 35 mg/dL). Furthermore, machine learning-based estimation of sdLDL-C level by artificial intelligence software, Prediction One, was substantially improved by using components of Sampson's equation (R(2)=0.803) and by using those components with the addition of gammaGTP and deletion of TC (R(2)=0.929). CONCLUSIONS: sdLDL-C level estimated by Sampson's equation can be used instead of measured sdLDL-C level in general practice. By building multiple machine learning models of artificial intelligence, a more accurate and practical estimation of sdLDL-C level might be possible.",

METHODS: Our approach included the creation of AI-based recognition technology that automatically logs users' urination activities, as well as the development of technology that analyzes movements to prevent neurogenic bladder. Initially, we employed a recurrent neural network model for the urination activity recognition technology. For predicting the risk of neurogenic bladder, we utilized convolutional neural network (CNN)-based AI technology. RESULTS: The performance of the proposed system was evaluated using a study population of 30 patients with urinary tract dysfunction, who collected data over a 60-day period. The results demonstrated an average accuracy of 94.2% in recognizing urinary tract activity, thereby confirming the effectiveness of the recognition technology. Furthermore, the motion analysis technology for preventing neurogenic bladder, which also employed CNN-based AI, showed promising results with an average accuracy of 83%. CONCLUSION: In this study, we developed a urination disease monitoring system aimed at predicting and managing risks for patients with urination issues. The system is designed to support the entire care cycle of a patient by leveraging AI technology that processes various image and signal data.

            "chunk": "AIMS: The increasing use of insertable cardiac monitors (ICM) produces a high rate of false positive (FP) diagnoses. Their verification results in a high workload for caregivers. We evaluated the performance of an artificial intelligence (AI)-based ILR-ECG Analyzer (ILR-ECG-A). This machine-learning algorithm reclassifies ICM-transmitted events to minimize the rate of FP diagnoses, while preserving device sensitivity. METHODS AND RESULTS: We selected 546 recipients of ICM followed by the Implicity monitoring platform. To avoid clusterization, a single episode per ICM abnormal diagnosis (e.g. asystole, bradycardia, atrial tachycardia (AT)/atrial fibrillation (AF), ventricular tachycardia, artefact) was selected per patient, and analyzed by the ILR-ECG-A, applying the same diagnoses as the ICM. All episodes were reviewed by an adjudication committee (AC) and the results were compared. Among 879 episodes classified as abnormal by the ICM, 80 (9.1%) were adjudicated as 'Artefacts', 283 (32.2%) as FP, and 516 (58.7%) as 'abnormal' by the AC. The algorithm reclassified 215 of the 283 FP as normal (76.0%), and confirmed 509 of the 516 episodes as abnormal (98.6%). Seven undiagnosed false negatives were adjudicated as AT or non-specific abnormality. The overall diagnostic specificity was 76.0% and the sensitivity was 98.6%. CONCLUSION: The new AI-based ILR-ECG-A lowered the rate of FP ICM diagnoses significantly while retaining a > 98% sensitivity. This will likely alleviate considerably the clinical burden represented by the review of ICM events.",

The brain activity of individuals with FD and IBS differs from that of healthy controls. Artificial intelligence can distinguish healthy controls from individuals with DGBI using several biomarkers. This study aimed to establish an artificial intelligence-based diagnostic support system using food preferences and brain activity in patients with DGBI. Methods ROME IV criteria were used to diagnose patients with FD and IBS. Their food preference was scored using a visual analog scale, and brain activity in the prefrontal cortex was investigated using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). The diagnostic model was developed based on the brain activity and visual analog scale scores for food using an artificial neural network model. Results Forty-one participants, including 25 patients with DGBI were enrolled in the study. The accuracy of the artificial intelligence-based diagnostic model using an artificial neural network in differentiating between healthy controls and patients with DGBI and between healthy controls and those with FD were 72.3% and 77.1%, respectively. Conclusions The artificial intelligence-based diagnostic model using brain activity and preference to food images showed sufficiently high accuracy in distinguishing patients with DGBI from healthy controls, and those with FD from healthy controls. Therefore, the fNIRS system provides objective evidence for diagnosing DGBI.",

Due to the universal approximation theorem (Hornik et al., 1989), a neural network with one hidden layer can approximate any continuous function on compact support as long as the number of hidden units is sufficiently large. Statistically, a neural network can be classified into a nonlinear regression framework. However, if we consider it parametrically, due to the unidentifiability of the parameters, it is difficult to derive its asymptotic properties. Instead, we consider the estimation problem in a nonparametric regression framework and use the results from sieve estimation to establish the consistency, the rates of convergence and the asymptotic normality of the neural network estimators. We also illustrate the validity of the theories via simulations.",

Because DCIS is treated as early breast cancer, many women with harmless DCIS face overtreatment. To identify these women that may forego treatment, we hypothesized that DCIS morphometric features relate to the risk of subsequent iIBC. We developed an artificial intelligence-based DCIS morphometric analysis pipeline (AIDmap) to detect DCIS as a pathologist and measure morphological structures in hematoxylin-eosin-stained (H&E) tissue sections. These were from a case-control study of patients diagnosed with primary DCIS, treated by breast-conserving surgery without radiotherapy. We analyzed 689 WSIs of DCIS of which 226 were diagnosed with subsequent iIBC (cases) and 463 were not (controls). The distribution of 15 duct morphological measurements in each H&E was summarized in 55 morphometric variables. A ridge regression classifier with cross validation predicted 5-years-free of iIBC with an area-under the curve of 0.65 (95% CI 0.55-0.76). A morphometric signature based on the 30 variables most associated with outcome, identified lesions containing small-sized ducts, low number of cells and low DCIS/stroma area ratio. This signature was associated with lower iIBC risk in a multivariate regression model including grade, ER, HER2 and COX-2 expression (HR = 0.56; 95% CI 0.28-0.78). AIDmap has potential to identify harmless DCIS that may not need treatment.",

The genetic basis and pathophysiology of RLS are incompletely understood. Here, we present a whole-genome sequencing and genome-wide association meta-analysis of RLS cases (n = 9,851) and controls (n = 38,957) in three population-based biobanks (All of Us, Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging, and CARTaGENE). Genome-wide association analysis identified nine independent risk loci, of which eight had been previously reported, and one was a novel risk locus (LMX1B, rs35196838, OR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.09-1.19, p-value = 2.2 x 10(-9)). A genome-wide, gene-based common variant analysis identified GLO1 as an additional risk gene (p-value = 8.45 x 10(-7)). Furthermore, a transcriptome-wide association study also identified GLO1 and a previously unreported gene, ELFN1. A genetic correlation analysis revealed significant common variant overlaps between RLS and neuroticism (r(g) = 0.40, se = 0.08, p-value = 5.4 x 10(-7)), depression (r(g) = 0.35, se = 0.06, p-value = 2.17 x 10(-8)), and intelligence (r(g) = -0.20, se = 0.06, p-value = 4.0 x 10(-4)).

Due to its extensive volume and the presence of free-text, conventional text mining analysis have encountered challenges in processing these data. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) for natural language processing (NLP) have provided an unprecedented opportunity to identify key information from drug labeling, thereby enhancing safety reviews and support for regulatory decisions. We developed RxBERT, a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model pretrained on FDA human prescription drug labeling documents for an enhanced application of drug labeling documents in both research and drug review. RxBERT was derived from BioBERT with further training on human prescription drug labeling documents. RxBERT was demonstrated in several tasks using regulatory datasets, including those involved in the National Institutes of Technology Text Analysis Challenge Dataset (NIST TAC dataset), the FDA Adverse Drug Event Evaluation Dataset (ADE Eval dataset), and the classification of texts from submission packages into labeling sections (US Drug Labeling dataset). For all these tasks, RxBERT reached 86.5 F1-scores in both TAC and ADE Eval classification, respectively, and prediction accuracy of 87% for the US Drug Labeling dataset. Overall, RxBERT was shown to be as competitive or have better performance compared to other NLP approaches such as BERT, BioBERT, etc. In summary, we developed RxBERT, a transformer-based model specific for drug labeling that outperformed the original BERT model. RxBERT has the potential to be used to assist research scientists and FDA reviewers to better process and utilize drug labeling information toward the advancement of drug effectiveness and safety for public health. This proof-of-concept study also demonstrated a potential pathway to customized large language models (LLMs) tailored to the sensitive regulatory documents for internal application.",

Materials and Methods This secondary, post hoc analysis included 120 participants (mean age, 59.7 years +/- 10.8 [SD]; 73 [60.8%] men, 47 [39.2%] women) from three large clinical trials (AFFECTS, P3, REFINE) who underwent CCTA and invasive coronary angiography with QCA. Quantitative analysis of coronary stenosis severity at CCTA was performed using an AI-based coronary stenosis quantification (AI-CSQ) software service. Blinded comparison between QCA and AI-CSQ was measured on a per-vessel and per-patient basis. Results The per-vessel AI-CSQ diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 80%, 88%, 86%, 65%, and 94%, respectively, for diameter stenosis (DS) 50% or greater; and 78%, 92%, 91%, 47%, and 98%, respectively, for DS 70% or greater. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) to predict DS of 50% or greater and 70% or greater on a per-vessel basis were 0.92 (95% CI: 0.88, 0.95; P < .001) and 0.93 (95% CI: 0.89, 0.97; P < .001), respectively. The AUCs to predict DS of 50% or greater and 70% or greater on a per-patient basis were 0.93 (95% CI: 0.88, 0.97; P < .001) and 0.88 (95% CI: 0.81, 0.94; P < .001), respectively. Conclusion AI-CSQ at CCTA demonstrated a high diagnostic performance compared with QCA both on a per-patient and per-vessel basis, with high sensitivity for stenosis detection.

Traditional approaches often fail to adequately address these issues, creating stressful and inequitable learning environments. This article introduces the concept of precision education, a data-driven paradigm aimed at personalizing the educational experience for each learner. It explores how Artificial Intelligence (AI), including its subsets Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL), can augment this model to tackle the inherent limitations of traditional assessment methods.AI can enable proactive data collection, offering consistent and objective assessments while reducing resource burdens. It has the potential to revolutionize not only competency assessment but also participatory interventions, such as personalized coaching and predictive analytics for at-risk trainees. The article also discusses key challenges and ethical considerations in integrating AI into medical education, such as algorithmic transparency, data privacy, and the potential for bias propagation.AI's capacity to process large datasets and identify patterns allows for a more nuanced, individualized approach to medical education. It offers promising avenues to not only improve the efficiency of educational assessments but also to make them more equitable. However, the ethical and technical challenges must be diligently addressed. The article concludes that embracing AI in medical education assessment is a strategic move toward creating a more personalized, effective, and fair educational landscape.

RESULTS: The study assessed the consistency of responses provided by ChatGPT, yielding an Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) value of 0.936 (95% CI, 0.913-0.954, p < 0.001) (with CST) and 0.915 (95% CI, 0.706-0.846, p < 0.001) (without CST), both situations indicated excellent reliability. The sensitivity and specificity of ChatGPT in predicting the DR cases were evaluated. The results revealed a sensitivity of 67% with CST and 73% without CST. The specificity was 68% with CST and 54% without CST. However, Cohen's kappa revealed only a fair agreement between ChatGPT predictions and clinical DR status in both situations, with CST (kappa = 0.263, p = 0.005) and without CST (kappa = 0.351, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: This study suggests that ChatGPT has the potential of a preliminary DR screening tool with further optimization needed for clinical use.",

            "chunk": "INTRODUCTION: Due to the inefficiency and high cost of the current healthcare supply chain mode, in order to adapt to the great changes in the global economy and public health, it is urgent to choose an effective mode for sustainable development of healthcare supply chain. The aim of this paper is to use artificial intelligence systems to make intelligent decisions for healthcare supply chain mode selection. METHODS: Firstly, according to the economic benefits, social benefits and environmental benefits of healthcare supply chain, this paper identifies different healthcare supply chain modes in combination with artificial intelligence technology. Secondly, this paper presents the intelligent choice optimization method of healthcare supply chain mode based on deep reinforcement learning algorithm. Finally, the effect of artificial intelligence in healthcare supply chain mode selection is verified by simulation experiment. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The experimental results show that healthcare supply chain mode selected by artificial intelligence is basically consistent with the target mode, while healthcare supply chain mode selected by the basic selection method, BP neural network method and big data method is different from the target mode, which indicates that AI has more advantages in the selection of medical supply chain mode. Therefore, we recommend the application of artificial intelligence to healthcare supply chain management. This study not only makes up for the ineffective problems of existing methods, but also makes up for the gaps in the application of AI technology in the field of healthcare supply chain. The scientific value of this paper is that the proposed framework and the artificial intelligence algorithm enrich the relevant theories of healthcare supply chain research and provide methodological guidance for intelligent decision-making of healthcare supply chain. At the same time, for medical enterprises, this research provides a new practical guideline for the application of artificial intelligence in the sustainable development and modern management of healthcare supply chain.",

While e-Stroke has the potential to improve the speed and accuracy of diagnosis, real-world validation is essential. The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate the performance of Brainomix e-Stroke in an unselected cohort of patients with suspected acute ischaemic stroke. METHODS: The study cohort included all patients admitted to the University College London Hospital Hyperacute Stroke Unit between October 2021 and April 2022. For e-ASPECTS and e-CTA, the ground truth was determined by a neuroradiologist with access to all clinical and imaging data. For e-CTP, the values of the core infarct and ischaemic penumbra were compared with those derived from syngo.via, an alternate software used at our institution. RESULTS: 1163 studies were performed in 551 patients admitted during the study period. Of these, 1130 (97.2%) were successfully processed by e-Stroke in an average of 4 min. For identifying acute middle cerebral artery territory ischaemia, e-ASPECTS had an accuracy of 77.0% and was more specific (83.5%) than sensitive (58.6%). The accuracy for identifying hyperdense thrombus was lower (69.1%), which was mainly due to many false positives (positive predictive value of 22.9%). Identification of acute haemorrhage was highly accurate (97.8%) with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 97.6%; false positives were typically caused by areas of calcification. The accuracy of e-CTA for large vessel occlusions was 91.5%. The core infarct and ischaemic penumbra volumes provided by e-CTP strongly correlated with those provided by syngo.via (rho=0.804-0.979). CONCLUSION: Brainomix e-Stroke software provides rapid and reliable analysis of CT imaging in the acute stroke setting although, in line with the manufacturer's guidance, it should be used as an adjunct to expert interpretation rather than a standalone decision-making tool.",

This study aimed to assess the validity of a patch-wise, individual interpretation of cortical thickness data to identify GM pathology, the \"mosaic approach,\" which was previously suggested as a biomarker for assessing and localizing atrophy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated the mosaic approach in a cohort of 501 patients with MS with respect to 89 internal and 651 external controls. The resulting metric of the mosaic approach is the so-called thin patch fraction, which is an estimate of overall cortical disease burden per patient. We evaluated the mosaic approach with respect to the following: 1) discrimination between patients with MS and controls, 2) classification between different MS phenotypes, and 3) association with established biomarkers reflecting MS disease burden, using general linear modeling. RESULTS: The thin patch fraction varied significantly between patients with MS and healthy controls and discriminated among MS phenotypes. Furthermore, the thin patch fraction was associated with disease burden, including the Expanded Disability Status Scale, cognitive and fatigue scores, and lesion volume. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the validity of the mosaic approach as a neuroradiologic biomarker in MS. The output of the mosaic approach, namely the thin patch fraction, is a candidate biomarker for assessing and localizing cortical GM pathology. The mosaic approach can furthermore enhance the development of a personalized cortical MS biomarker, given that the thin patch fraction provides a feature on which artificial intelligence methods can be trained. Most important, we showed the validity of the mosaic approach when referencing data with respect to external control MR imaging repositories.",

It is also unknown if AI-enabled single-lead ECGs could be used as a diagnostic tool for LAE surveillance. We aimed to build AI-enabled P-wave and single-lead ECG models to identify LAE using sinus rhythm (SR) and/or non-SR ECGs, and compared the prognostic ability of severe LAE as left atrial diameter (LAD) >/=50 mm assessed by AI-enabled ECG models and echocardiography. METHODS: This retrospective study used data from 382,594 consecutive adults with paired 12-lead ECG and echocardiograms measured within 2 weeks at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. UNet++ was used for P-wave segmentation. ResNet-18 was used to develop deep convolutional neural network-enabled ECG models for discriminating LAE. External validation was performed using data from 11,753 patients from another hospital. RESULTS: The AI-enabled 12-lead ECG model outperformed other ECG models for classifying LAE, but the single-lead ECG models also showed excellent performance at an LAD cut-off 50 mm. AI-enabled ECG models had excellent and fair discrimination on LAE using the SR and the non-SR dataset, respectively. Severe LAE identified by AI-enabled ECG models was more predictive of future cardiovascular disease than echocardiography; however, the cumulative incidence of new-onset atrial fibrillation and heart failure was higher in patients with echocardiography-severe LAE than AI-enabled ECG-severe LAE. CONCLUSIONS: P wave plays a crucial role in discriminating LAE in AI-enabled ECG models. AI-enabled ECG models outperform echocardiography in predicting new-onset cardiovascular diseases associated with severe LAE.",

This overview covers models that measure treatment response based on statistical or machine-learning methods, or a combination of the two. We briefly discuss a computational model that allows integration of immune/biological system knowledge with mathematical modeling and also involves a 'digital twin', which allows measurement of temporal trends in mucosal inflammatory activity for predicting treatment response. A viewpoint on AI-enabled wearables and nearables and their use to improve IBD management is also included.

By automatically identifying the attention level, teachers can employ strategies to regain students' focus. This can be achieved through various sources of information. One source is to analyze the emotions reflected on students' faces. AI can detect emotions, such as neutral, disgust, surprise, sadness, fear, happiness, and anger. Additionally, the direction of the students' gaze can also potentially indicate their level of attention. Another source is to observe the students' body posture. By using cameras and deep learning techniques, posture can be analyzed to determine the level of attention. For example, students who are slouching or resting their heads on their desks may have a lower level of attention. Smartwatches distributed to the students can provide biometric and other data, including heart rate and inertial measurements, which can also be used as indicators of attention. By combining these sources of information, an AI system can be trained to identify the level of attention in the classroom. However, integrating the different types of data poses a challenge that requires creating a labeled dataset. Expert input and existing studies are consulted for accurate labeling. In this paper, we propose the integration of such measurements and the creation of a dataset and a potential attention classifier. To provide feedback to the teacher, we explore various methods, such as smartwatches or direct computers. Once the teacher becomes aware of attention issues, they can adjust their teaching approach to re-engage and motivate the students. In summary, AI techniques can automatically identify the students' attention level by analyzing their emotions, gaze direction, body posture, and biometric data. This information can assist teachers in optimizing the teaching-learning process.",

SETTING: Outpatient rehabilitation clinic. PARTICIPANTS: Patients (N=38; mean age, 48.5y; 71% women) at the Cognitive Post COVID-19 Clinic at Danderyd University Hospital in Stockholm, Sweden, who sought health care because of self-experienced cognitive problems. All had at least 4 years of university education and an initially mild infection (ie, most were not hospital admitted, none were admitted to intensive care). INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cognitive test performance assessed with a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery including Information, Matrix Reasoning, Coding, and Digit Span from Wechsler's Adult Intelligence Scale-IV, Buschke Selective Reminding Test, Rey Complex Figure Test, Ruff 2&7, Color-Word Interference Test, Verbal Fluency, and Trail Making Test. The mean time between the infection and the assessment was 18 months. RESULTS: Cognitive deficits were evident on tests of verbal learning and memory (Buschke Selective Reminding Test) and selective attention (Ruff 2&7). Approximately 50% of the participants had scores lower than 1 SD below the mean in the norm group on the measures of verbal learning and memory. When estimated premorbid cognitive functioning was accounted for, deficits were suggested in most cognitive domains. CONCLUSIONS: Post COVID-19 condition seems to be associated with cognitive deficits, even in patients with high education and an initially mild infection.",

As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes more prevalent in educational settings, understanding its effects on language learning outcomes is crucial. METHODS: The study employs a comprehensive approach, combining quantitative and qualitative methods. The quantitative phase utilizes a pre-test and post-test design to assess writing skills. Fifty EFL students, matched for proficiency, are randomly assigned to experimental (AI-assisted instruction via ChatGPT) or control (traditional instruction) groups. Writing samples are evaluated using established scoring rubrics. Concurrently, semi-structured interviews are conducted with a subset of participants to explore writing motivation and experiences with AI-assisted learning. RESULTS: Quantitative analysis reveals significant improvements in both writing skills and motivation among students who received AI-assisted instruction compared to the control group. The experimental group demonstrates enhanced proficiency in various aspects of writing, including organization, coherence, grammar, and vocabulary. Qualitative findings showcase diverse perspectives, ranging from recognition of AI's innovative instructional role and its positive influence on writing skills and motivation to concerns about contextual accuracy and over-reliance. Participants also reflect on the long-term impact and sustainability of AI-assisted instruction, emphasizing the need for ongoing development and adaptation of AI tools.

The current study examines the actions of the agricultural fungicide vinclozolin on the F0 generation, followed by jet fuel hydrocarbon mixture exposure of the F1 generation, and then pesticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane on the F2 generation gestating females. The subsequent F3 and F4 generations and F5 transgenerational generation were obtained and F1-F5 generations examined for male sperm epigenetic alterations and pathology in males and females. Significant impacts on the male sperm differential DNA methylation regions were observed. The F3-F5 generations were similar in  approximately 50% of the DNA methylation regions. The pathology of each generation was assessed in the testis, ovary, kidney, and prostate, as well as the presence of obesity and tumors. The pathology used a newly developed Deep Learning, artificial intelligence-based histopathology analysis. Observations demonstrated compounded disease impacts in obesity and metabolic parameters, but other pathologies plateaued with smaller increases at the F5 transgenerational generation. Observations demonstrate that multiple generational exposures, which occur in human populations, appear to increase epigenetic impacts and disease susceptibility.",

The first example is the implementation of targeted multiple health condition reviews via a population health management approach across general practice in the City of Manchester. The second example is the development of a person-centred risk stratification tool, focused on unmet cardiovascular need, called 'CVNeed'. This tool provides a unique approach to highlighting the highest unmet need and, thus, the largest return on investment to the system from proactive efforts. These examples demonstrate how a person-centred, multiple health condition approach to long-term condition management, enabled by data intelligence to drive prioritisation of clinical need, can help to address longstanding health inequalities and unwarranted variation in health outcomes.

METHODS: In this study, we constructed a medical record quality control system based on AI. We first designed and built, for the system, a quality control rule base based on authoritative standards and expert opinions. Then, medical records data were automatically collected through a data acquisition engine and were converted into structured data through a post-structured engine. Finally, the medical record quality control engine was combined with the rule base to analyze the data, identify quality problems, and realize automated intelligent quality control. This system was applied to the quality control of medical records and five quality control points were selected, including similarities in the history of the present illness, defects in the description of chief complaints, incomplete initial diagnosis, missing in formation in the history of menstruation, marriage, and childbirth, and mismatch between the chief complaints and the history of the present illness. We randomly selected 2 918 medical records of patients discharged in January 2022 to conduct AI quality control. Then we organized medical record quality control experts to conduct an accuracy review, made a comparison with previous manual quality control records, and analyzed the results. The number of quality problems that were verified in the accuracy review was taken as the gold standard and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were drawn for the 5 quality control points. RESULTS: According to the accuracy review performed by medical record quality control experts, the accuracy of AI quality control reached 89.57%. For the sampled medical records, the results of AI quality control were compared with those of previous manually performed quality control and only one problem detected by manual quality control of the sampled medical records was not detected by the AI quality control system. The number of medical record quality problems correctly detected by AI quality control was about 2.97 times that of manual quality control. Analysis of the ROC curves showed that the AUC of the five quality control points of the AI quality control system were statistically significant (P<0.05) and all the AUC values approximated or exceeded 0.9. In contrast, results obtained through manually performed quality control found significant AUC (0.797) for only one quality control point-similarities in the history of present illness (P<0.05). Comparison of the AUC values of the two quality control methods showed that AI quality control system had an advantage over manually performed quality control for the five quality control points. CONCLUSION: Through the application of medical record quality control system based on AI, efficient full quality control of medical record documentation can be achieved and the detection rate of quality problems can be effectively improved. In addition, the system helps save manpower and improve the quality of medical record documentation.",

            "chunk": "The medical profession has experienced a significant increase in the number of women practitioners in recent decades, leading to a reduction in the gender gap. According to the United States Medical Association, approximately 25% of physicians in the United States are now women. Although this progress is evident in the clinical setting, women's representation in academic medicine remains disproportionately low. The underrepresentation of women in academia has various consequences, including limited access to academic resources and hindered career growth. Previous studies have attempted to analyze these disparities, but results have been inconsistent, and the issue's complexity has not been fully understood. This study aims to examine the disparity in the gender of first authors in academic publications related to \" Artificial intelligence (AI) and Attention Deficit Hyperkinetic Disorder (ADHD)\" between 2010 and 2023. Analysis was conducted on June 21st, 2023, using the database PubMed. The search term \"AI\" AND \"ADHD\" was used to derive all articles over a period of 13 years, from January 1st, 2010, to December 31st, 2022, excluding the year 2023 due to limited available publications. The relevant articles were downloaded in Microsoft Excel sheets. The gender of the first authors was determined using the NamSor app V.2, an application programming interface (API) with a large dataset of names and countries of origin. A total of 204 articles were considered for this study. There were 78 female first authors and 126 male first authors. The highest number of publications with a male first author occurred in 2022, with 32 publications. The Netherlands, Singapore, Turkey, and China have the highest gender ratios, indicating a more favourable representation of both genders. The p-value of 0.2664 suggests that there is no significant association between gender and country. The findings revealed a gender disparity, with a higher number of male first authors. By addressing and rectifying these disparities, we can enhance the overall quality, diversity, and inclusivity of research in the field of ADHD and Artificial Intelligence.",

Methodology A cross-sectional, online, descriptive survey design was adopted in this study. The survey instrument incorporated the Ideal Patient Autonomy Scale (IPAS) and other factors affecting patient autonomy in the AI-patient relationship. The study participants included 74 physicians, 55 dieticians, and 273 obese patients. Results Different views were expressed in the scales AI knows the best (mu = 2.95-3.15) and the patient should decide (mu = 2.95-3.16). Ethical concerns (mu = 3.24) and perceived privacy risks (mu = 3.58) were identified as having a more negative influence on patient autonomy compared to personal innovativeness (mu = 2.41) and trust (mu = 2.85). Physicians and dieticians expressed significantly higher trust in AI compared to patients (p < 0.05). Conclusions Patient autonomy in the AI-patient relationship is significantly affected by privacy, trust, and ethical issues. As trust is a multifaceted factor and AI is a novel technology in healthcare, it is essential to fully explore the various factors influencing trust and patient autonomy.",

            "chunk-id": 1,
            "chunk": "The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into healthcare in Africa presents transformative opportunities but also raises profound legal challenges, especially concerning liability. As AI becomes more autonomous, determining who or what is responsible when things go wrong becomes ambiguous. This article aims to review the legal concepts relevant to the issue of liability for harm caused by AI in healthcare. While some suggest attributing legal personhood to AI as a potential solution, the feasibility of this remains controversial. The principal-agent relationship, where the physician is held responsible for AI decisions, risks reducing the adoption of AI tools due to potential liabilities. Similarly, using product law to establish liability is problematic because of the dynamic learning nature of AI, which deviates from static products. This fluidity complicates traditional definitions of product defects and, by extension, where responsibility lies. Exploring alternatives, risk-based determinations of liability, which focus on potential hazards rather than on specific fault assignments, emerges as a potential pathway. However, these, too, present challenges in assigning accountability. Strict liability has been proposed as another avenue. It can simplify the compensation process for victims by focusing on the harm rather than on the fault. Yet, concerns arise over the economic impact on stakeholders, the potential for unjust reputational damage, and the feasibility of a global application. Instead of approaches based on liability, reconciliation holds much promise to facilitate regulatory sandboxes. In conclusion, while the integration of AI systems into healthcare holds vast potential, it necessitates a re-evaluation of our legal frameworks. The central challenge is how to adapt traditional concepts of liability to the novel and unpredictable nature of AI-or to move away from liability towards reconciliation. Future discussions and research must navigate these complex waters and seek solutions that ensure both progress and protection.",

Availability of prenatal diagnostics, insufficient information from traditional imaging techniques, previously unforeseen medical complications, and debates surrounding optimal timing and indications for reintervention are among the emerging issues. To address these challenges, the integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning holds great promise as they have the potential to revolutionize patient management and positively impact lifelong outcomes for individuals with TOF. Innovative applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning have spanned across multiple domains of TOF care, including screening and diagnosis, automated image processing and interpretation, clinical risk stratification, and planning and performing cardiac interventions.

In this study, we demonstrate that a human-machine collaboration based on stepwise-evolving artificial intelligence (se-AI) can significantly shorten the development period of PGM-free multimetal OER electrocatalysts with performance beyond a PGM of RuO(2). We were able to reach optimized materials only after 2% experimental trials of the entire candidate pool. The best PGM-free electrocatalyst discovered exhibited excellent activity comparable to RuO(2) and, surprisingly, also demonstrated superior stability with a high current density of up to 1000 mA/cm(2) at even pH 9.2, which condition is a thermodynamically challenging for typical PGM-free materials.

These metamaterials are constructed from interconnected and periodically arranged logic unit cells that are able to perform compound logic operations coupling multiplication and negation. The scalable computation capacity of the unit cell empowers it to simultaneously process multiple fluidic signals with different types and magnitudes, thereby allowing the execution of sophisticated and high-level control operations. By establishing the laws of physical Boolean algebra and formulating a universal design route, soft metamaterials capable of diverse logic operations can be readily created and reprogrammed. Besides, the metamaterials' potential of directly serving as fluidic processors for soft machines is validated by constructing a soft latched demultiplexer, soft controllers capable of universal and customizable morphing programming, and a reprogrammable processor without reconnection.

METHOD: In this cross-sectional study, we used artificial intelligence (AI) -assisted optical coherence tomography (OCT) to analyze the thickness and volume of macula in Moyamoya patients. ETDRS zoning divides the macula into nine different regions. In 15 patients with radial scanning OCT, the average thickness and volume of retina, RNFL, GCL, and choroid in these regions were measured. In 30 patients with radial or horizontal scanning OCT, based on the anatomical structure, the macula is divided into seven segments. Mean Sattler layer-choriocapillaris complex thickness (SLCCT), Haller layer thickness, and total choroidal thickness were measured for each segment using AI-assisted OCT. RESULTS: We recruited 30 patients (59 eyes) with MMD. In the 15 patients (29 eyes) who underwent radial scanning OCT, no significant change in retina, RNFL, GCL, and choroidal thickness was identified between the two groups (p > 0.05). There was no significant change in retina, RNFL, or choroidal volume between the two groups in different ETDRS macula regions (p > 0.05). The GCL volume in the macula's inner ring nasal portion (IN) was significantly lower. SLCCTs were considerably reduced in six macula regions in moyamoya groups (p < 0.05). There was no statistically significant change in Haller layer thickness. Only the nasal perifovea (PE_N) exhibited a significant variation in choroidal thickness. The Moyamoya group showed reduced choroidal thickness in PE_N segment. CONCLUSION: In patients with MMD, there is thinning of the Sattler layer-choriocapillaris complex in the choroid.",

The focus has been on imaging metabolism of hyperpolarized probes, which requires long T(1), high polarization and rapid contrast generation. Efforts to establish novel probes, improve acquisition techniques and enhance data analysis methods including artificial intelligence are ongoing. Potential clinical value of hyperpolarized (13)C MRI was demonstrated primarily for treatment response assessment in oncology, but also in cardiology, nephrology, hepatology and CNS characterization. In this review on biomedical hyperpolarized (13)C MRI, we summarize important and recent advances in polarization techniques, probe development, acquisition and analysis methods as well as clinical trials. Starting from those we try to sketch a trajectory where the field of biomedical hyperpolarized (13)C MRI might go.",

            "chunk": "INTRODUCTION: Understanding noncognitive traits like emotional intelligence (EI) is valuable for radiography students, academics, practitioners, and educators. It helps them become aware of how these traits can impact their training, placements, and careers. This study aimed to evaluate the EI of radiography students at a tertiary institute in Harare, Zimbabwe. METHODS: A quantitative cross-sectional study using a validated Trait EI questionnaire was conducted on students at a tertiary institute in Harare, Zimbabwe. Student t-test, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and Spearman's rho were employed for data analysis. RESULTS: A total of 84 radiography students were enrolled in this study. The students had relatively lower EI scores (4.31 +/-0.49) as compared to most of their global counterparts. A significant positive monotonic relationship was identified between age and self-control factor (Spearman's rho = 0.22, p = 0.04). There were no statistically significant differences in mean scores for the global and the four EI factors when stratified by gender, even though males had slightly higher scores than females in all but the emotionality factor. There were no significant differences in the mean scores of the global as well as the four factors by year of study. CONCLUSION: Deliberate, time-intensive curriculum interventions are needed to improve the EI of radiography students in Zimbabwe and this trend is potentially similar to other resource-limited settings. However, more context-specific evidence is needed to formulate the best techniques for EI interventions.",

AI models have recently demonstrated remarkable ability at analysing and solving problems, including passing professional examinations. We investigate the performance of ChatGPT on some of the UK radiology fellowship equivalent examination questions. METHODS: ChatGPT was asked to answer questions from question banks resembling the Fellowship of the Royal College of Radiologists (FRCR) examination. The entire physics part 1 question bank (203 5-part true/false questions) was answered by the GPT-4 model and answers recorded. 240 single best answer questions (SBAs) (representing the true length of the FRCR 2A examination) were answered by both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models. RESULTS: ChatGPT 4 answered 74.8% of part 1 true/false statements correctly. The spring 2023 passing mark of the part 1 examination was 75.5% and ChatGPT thus narrowly failed. In the 2A examination, ChatGPT 3.5 answered 50.8% SBAs correctly, while GPT-4 answered 74.2% correctly. The winter 2022 2A pass mark was 63.3% and thus GPT-4 clearly passed. CONCLUSION: AI models such as ChatGPT are able to answer the majority of questions in an FRCR style examination. It is reasonable to assume that further developments in AI will be more likely to succeed in comprehending and solving questions related to medicine, specifically clinical radiology. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: Our findings outline the unprecedented capabilities of AI, adding to the current relatively small body of literature on the subject, which in turn can play a role medical training, evaluation and practice. This can undoubtedly have implications for radiology.",

            "chunk-id": 1,
            "chunk": "PURPOSE: Implementing artificial intelligence technologies allows for the accurate prediction of radiation therapy dose distributions, enhancing treatment planning efficiency. However, esophageal cancers present unique challenges because of tumor complexity and diverse prescription types. Additionally, limited data availability hampers the effectiveness of existing artificial intelligence models. This study developed a deep learning model, trained on a diverse data set of esophageal cancer prescriptions, to improve dose prediction accuracy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We retrospectively collected data from 530 patients with esophageal cancer, including single-target and simultaneous integrated boost prescriptions, for model building. The proposed Asymmetric ResNeSt (AS-NeSt) model features novel 3-dimensional (3D) ResNeSt blocks and an asymmetrical architecture. We constructed a loss function targeting global and local doses and validated the model's performance against existing alternatives. Model-assisted experiments were used to validate its clinical benefits. RESULTS: The AS-NeSt model maintained an absolute prediction error below 5% for each dosimetric metric. The average Dice similarity coefficient for isodose volumes was 0.93. The model achieved an average relative prediction error of 2.02%, statistically lower than Hierarchically Densely Connected U-net (4.17%), DoseNet (2.35%), and Densely Connected Network (3.65%). It also demonstrated significantly fewer parameters and shorter prediction times. Clinically, the AS-NeSt model raised physicians' ability to accurately preassess appropriate treatment methods before planning from 95.24% to 100%, reduced planning time by over 61% for junior dosimetrists and 52% for senior dosimetrists, and decreased both inter- and intra-dosimetrist discrepancies by more than 50%. CONCLUSIONS: The AS-NeSt model, developed with innovative 3D ResNeSt blocks and an asymmetrical encoder-decoder structure, has been validated using clinical esophageal cancer patient data. It accurately predicts 3D dose distributions for various prescriptions, including simultaneous integrated boost, showing potential to improve the management of esophageal cancer treatment in a clinical setting.",

This review offers insight into how these integrative innovations compare with conventional approaches in spine surgery, focusing on machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence, augmented reality and virtual reality, and spinal navigation systems. Data on technology applications, diagnostic and procedural accuracy, intraoperative times, radiation exposures, postoperative outcomes, and costs were extracted and compared with conventional methods to assess their advantages and limitations. Preoperatively, augmented reality and virtual reality have applications in surgical training and planning that are more immersive, case specific, and risk-free and have been shown to enhance accuracy and reduce complications. ML algorithms have demonstrated high accuracy in predicting surgical candidacy (up to 92.1%) and tailoring personalized treatments based on patient-specific variables. Intraoperatively, advantages include more accurate pedicle screw insertion (96%-99% with ML), enhanced visualization, reduced radiation exposure (49 muSv with O-arm navigation vs. 556 muSv with fluoroscopy), increased efficiency, and potential for fewer intraoperative complications compared with conventional approaches. Postoperatively, certain ML and artificial intelligence models have outperformed conventional methods in predicting all postoperative complications of >6000 patients as well as predicting variables contributing to in-hospital and 90-day mortality. However, applying these technologies comes with limitations, such as longer operative times (up to 35.6% longer) with navigation, dependency on datasets, costs, accessibility, steep learning curve, and inherent software malfunctions. As these technologies advance, continuing to assess their efficacy and limitations will be crucial to their successful integration within spine surgery.",

Previous studies have explored anoikis-related genes (ARG) in predicting prognosis and distinguishing tumoral immunity in many types of cancer. However, the role of ARGs in regulating NK cell exhaustion (NKE) and in predicting chemotherapy sensitivity is not clear. Therefore, it is necessary to work on it. METHODS: Gene expression profiles and clinical features are collected from TCGA and GEO, and data analysis is performed in R4.2.0. RESULTS: The ARGs-based no-supervised learning algorithm identifies three ARG subgroups, amongst which the prognosis is different. WCGNA and Artificial intelligence (AI) are applied to construct an NKE-related drug sensitivity stratification and prognosis identification model in digestive system cancer. Pathways association analysis screens out GLI2 is a key gene in regulating NKE by non-classic Hedgehog signaling (GLI2/TGF-beta/IL6). In vitro experiments show that down-regulation of GLI2 enhances the CAPE-mediated cell toxicity and accompanies with down-regulation of PD-L1, tumor-derive IL6, and snial1 whereas the expression of cleaved caspas3, cleaved caspase4, cleaved PARP, and E-cadherin are up-regulated in colorectal cancer. Co-culture experiments show that GLI2- decreased colorectal tumor cells lead to down-regulation of TIM-3 and PD1 in NK cells, which are restored by TGF-bate active protein powder. Besides, the Elisa assay shows that GLI2-decreased colorectal tumor cells lead to up-regulation of IFN-gamma in NK cells.",

METHODS: In this retrospective study, fully automated CT-based body composition algorithms for quantifying bone attenuation, muscle attenuation, muscle area, liver attenuation, liver volume, spleen volume, visceral-to-subcutaneous fat ratio (VSR) and aortic calcium were applied to both thin (1.25 x 0.625 mm) and thick (5 x 3 mm) abdominal CT series from two patient cohorts: unenhanced scans in asymptomatic adults undergoing colorectal cancer screening, and post-contrast scans in patients with colorectal cancer. Body composition measures derived from thin and thick slice data were compared, including correlation coefficients and Bland-Altman analysis. RESULTS: A total of 9882 CT scans (mean age, 57.0 years; 4527 women, 5355 men) were evaluated, including 8947 non-contrast and 935 contrast-enhanced CT exams. Very strong positive correlation was observed for all soft tissue measures: muscle attenuation (r(2) = 0.97), muscle area (r(2) = 0.98), liver attenuation (r(2) = 0.99), liver volume (r(2) = 0.98) and spleen volume (r(2) = 0.99), VSR (r(2) = 0.98), and aortic calcium (r(2) = 0.92); (p < 0.001 for all). Moderate positive correlation was observed for bone attenuation (r(2) = 0.35). Bland-Altman analysis showed strong agreement for muscle attenuation, muscle area, liver attenuation, liver volume and spleen volume. Mean percentage differences amongst body composition measures were less than 5% for VSR (4.6%), muscle area (- 0.5%), liver attenuation (0.4%) and liver volume (2.7%) and less than 10% for muscle attenuation (- 5.5%) and spleen volume (5.1%). For aortic calcium, thick slice overestimated for Agatston scores between 0 and 100 and > 400 burden in 3.1% and 0.3% relative to thin slice, respectively, but underestimated scores between 100 and 400. CONCLUSION: Automated body composition measures derived from thin and thick abdominal CT data are strongly correlated and show agreement, particularly for soft tissue applications, making it feasible to use either series for these CT-based body composition algorithms.",

            "chunk": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the clinical method of choice for cartilage imaging in the context of degenerative and nondegenerative joint diseases. The MRI-based definitions of osteoarthritis rely on the detection of osteophytes, cartilage pathologies, bone marrow edema and meniscal lesions but currently a scientific consensus is lacking. In the clinical routine proton density-weighted, fat-suppressed 2D turbo spin echo sequences with echo times of 30-40\u202fms are predominantly used, which are sufficiently sensitive and specific for the assessment of cartilage. The additionally acquired T1-weighted sequences are primarily used for evaluating other intra-articular and periarticular structures. Diagnostically relevant artifacts include magic angle and chemical shift artifacts, which can lead to artificial signal enhancement in cartilage or incorrect representations of the subchondral lamina and its thickness. Although scientifically validated, high-resolution 3D gradient echo sequences (for cartilage segmentation) and compositional MR sequences (for quantification of physical tissue parameters) are currently reserved for scientific research questions. The future integration of artificial intelligence techniques in areas such as image reconstruction (to reduce scan times while maintaining image quality), image analysis (for automated identification of cartilage defects), and image postprocessing (for automated segmentation of cartilage in terms of volume and thickness) will significantly improve the diagnostic workflow and advance the field further.",

Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly impacting sport science and academia. In this study, we tested the accuracy and sensitivity of an AI-driven tool, applied specifically to sport science. DESIGN: Our research relies on the use of a new and free online AI-driven tool, the AJPC System, which claims the ability to distinguish \"normal\" (scholarly) from \"suspected predatory\" (unscholarly) journals. METHODS: The AJPC System was used to assess (1 December 2023) the classification of all ranked sport journals (n\u202f=\u202f124), namely those in all four quartiles (Q1-Q4) of SCImago Journal Rank (SJR), in the \"Sports Science\" category. RESULTS: The AJPC System considered 47/124 journals to be \"suspected predatory\", mostly in Q4 journals (54.8\u202f% of total), casting a negative image on their academic standing. CONCLUSIONS: Sport scientists are likely to consider SJR Q1-Q4 journals to be relatively safe to publish in, reliable and reputable, and might be confused with the \"suspected predatory\" label assigned to 37.9\u202f% of those journals. The AJPC System is thus misleading sport scientists.",

            "chunk": "STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: The evidence regarding the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in identifying dental implant systems is currently inconclusive. The available studies present varying results and methodologies, making it difficult to draw definitive conclusions. PURPOSE: The purpose of this systematic review with meta-analysis was to comprehensively analyze and evaluate articles that investigate the application of AI in identifying and classifying dental implant systems. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An electronic systematic review was conducted across 3 databases: MEDLINE/PubMed, Cochrane, and Scopus. Additionally, a manual search was performed. The inclusion criteria consisted of peer-reviewed studies investigating the accuracy of AI-based diagnostic tools on dental radiographs for identifying and classifying dental implant systems and comparing the results with those obtained by expert judges using manual techniques-the search strategy encompassed articles published until September 2023. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool was used to assess the quality of included articles. RESULTS: Twenty-two eligible articles were included in this review. These articles described the use of AI in detecting dental implants through conventional radiographs. The pooled data showed that dental implant identification had an overall accuracy of 92.56% (range 90.49% to 94.63%). Eleven studies showed a low risk of bias, 6 demonstrated some concern risk, and 5 showed a high risk of bias. CONCLUSIONS: AI models using panoramic and periapical radiographs can accurately identify and categorize dental implant systems. However, additional well-conducted research is recommended to identify the most common implant systems.",

            "chunk": "BACKGROUND: Relatively little is known about the immediate and prospective neurodevelopmental impacts of joint exposure to multiple metals (i.e., metal mixtures) in early childhood. OBJECTIVES: To estimate associations of early childhood ( approximately 3 years of age) blood metal concentrations with cognitive test scores at early and mid-childhood ( approximately 8 years of age). METHODS: We studied children from the Project Viva cohort. We measured erythrocyte concentrations of seven essential (Co, Cu, Mg, Mn, Mo, Se, and Zn) and eight non-essential metals (As, Ba, Cd, Cs, Hg, Pb, Sn, and Sr) in early childhood blood samples. Trained research assistants administered cognitive tests assessing vocabulary, visual-motor ability, memory, and general intelligence (standard deviations:  approximately 10 points), in early and mid-childhood. We employed multivariable linear regression to examine associations of individual metals with test scores adjusting for confounders, other concurrently measured metals, and first-trimester maternal blood metals. We also estimated joint associations and explored interaction between metals in mixture analyses. RESULTS: We analyzed 349 children (median whole blood Pb  approximately 1 mug/dL). In cross-sectional analyses, each doubling of Pb was associated with lower visual-motor function (mean difference: -2.43 points, 95% confidence interval (CI): -4.01, -0.86) and receptive vocabulary, i.e., words understood (-1.45 points, 95% CI: -3.26, 0.36). Associations of Pb with mid-childhood cognition were weaker and less precise by comparison. Mg was positively associated with cognition in cross-sectional but not prospective analyses, and cross-sectional associations were attenuated in a sensitivity analysis removing adjustment for concurrent metals. We did not observe joint associations nor interactions. DISCUSSION: In this cohort with low blood Pb levels, increased blood Pb was robustly associated with lower cognitive ability in cross-sectional analyses, even after adjustment for prenatal Pb exposure, and regardless of adjustment for metal co-exposures. However, associations with mid-childhood cognition were attenuated and imprecise, suggesting some buffering of Pb neurotoxicity in early life. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Relatively few studies have comprehensively separated the effects of neurotoxic metals such as lead (Pb) from pre- and postnatal co-occurring metals, nor examined persistence of associations across childhood. In a cohort of middle-class children, we found higher early childhood ( approximately 3 y) blood Pb was associated with lower scores on cognitive tests, independent of other metals and prenatal blood Pb. However, early childhood Pb was only weakly associated with cognition in mid-childhood ( approximately 8 y). Our results suggest the effects of low-level Pb exposure may attenuate over time in some populations, implying the presence of factors that may buffer Pb neurotoxicity in early life.",

Current genotype-phenotype paradigms are insufficient to accurately predict JEB subtype and characteristics from genotype, particularly for splice site variants, which account for over a fifth of disease-causing variants in JEB. This study evaluated the genetic and clinical findings from a JEB cohort, investigating genotype-phenotype correlations through bioinformatic analyses and comparison with previously reported variants. Eighteen unique variants in LAMB3, LAMA3, LAMC2, or COL17A1 were identified from 17 individuals. Seven had severe JEB, 9 had intermediate JEB, and 1 had laryngo-onycho-cutaneous syndrome. Seven variants were previously unreported. Deep phenotyping was completed for all intermediate JEB cases and demonstrated substantial variation between individuals. Splice site variants underwent analysis with SpliceAI, a state-of-the-art artificial intelligence tool, to predict resultant transcripts. Predicted functional effects included exon skipping and cryptic splice site activation, which provided potential explanations for disease severity and in most cases correlated with laminin-332 immunofluorescence. RT-PCR was performed for 1 case to investigate resultant transcripts produced from the splice site variant. This study expands the JEB genomic and phenotypic landscape. Artificial intelligence tools show potential for predicting the functional effects of splice site variants and may identify candidates for confirmatory laboratory investigation. Investigation of RNA transcripts will help to further elucidate genotype-phenotype correlations for novel variants.",

These advancements have deepened our understanding of tumor oncogenesis, enabling a more refined stratification of the biological behavior of these neoplasms. This progress culminated in the fifth edition of the WHO classification of central nervous system (CNS) tumors in 2021. This comprehensive review article aims to elucidate these advances within a multidisciplinary framework, contextualized within the backdrop of the new classification. This article will explore morphologic pathology and molecular/genetics techniques (immunohistochemistry, genetic sequencing, and methylation profiling), which are pivotal in diagnosis, besides the correlation of structural neuroimaging radiophenotypes to pathology and genetics. It briefly reviews the usefulness of tractography and functional neuroimaging in surgical planning. Additionally, the article addresses the value of other functional imaging techniques such as perfusion MRI, spectroscopy, and nuclear medicine in distinguishing tumor progression from treatment-related changes. Furthermore, it discusses the advantages of evolving diagnostic techniques in classifying these tumors, as well as their limitations in terms of availability and utilization. Moreover, the expanding domains of data processing, artificial intelligence, radiomics, and radiogenomics hold great promise and may soon exert a substantial influence on glioma diagnosis. These innovative technologies have the potential to revolutionize our approach to these tumors. Ultimately, this review underscores the fundamental importance of multidisciplinary collaboration in employing recent diagnostic advancements, thereby hoping to translate them into improved quality of life and extended survival for glioma patients.",

The purpose of this study was to broadly assess the effects of gender on postoperative outcomes following elective spine surgery. METHODS: Between November 2022 and March 2023, PubMed, MEDLINE, ERIC, and Embase were queried using artificial intelligence-assisted software for relevant cohort studies. Cohort studies with a minimum sample of 100 patients conducted in the United States since 2010 were eligible. Studies related to trauma, tumors, infections, and spinal cord pathology were excluded. Independent extraction by multiple reviewers was performed using Nested Knowledge software. A fixed- or random-effects model was used if heterogeneity among included studies in a meta-analysis was < 50% or >/= 50%, respectively. Risk of bias was assessed independently by multiple reviewers using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Pooled effect sizes were calculated for readmission, nonroutine discharge (NRD), length of stay (LOS), extended LOS, reoperation, mortality, all medical complications (individual analyses for cardiovascular, deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary embolism, genitourinary, neurological, respiratory, and systemic infection complications), and wound-related complications. For each outcome, two subanalyses were performed with studies that used either center-based (single- or multi-institution) or high-volume (national or state-wide) databases. RESULTS: Across 124 included studies, male patients had an increased incidence of mortality (OR 0.54, p < 0.0001) and all medical complications (OR 0.80, p = 0.0114), specifically cardiovascular (OR 0.68, p < 0.0001) and respiratory (OR 0.76, p = 0.0008) complications. Female patients were more likely to experience a wound-related surgical complication (OR 1.16, p = 0.0183). These findings persisted in the high-volume database subanalyses. Only center-based subanalyses showed that female patients were at greater odds of experiencing an NRD (OR 1.18, p = 0.0476), longer LOS (SMD 0.23, p = 0.0036), and extended LOS (OR 1.28, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Males are more likely to experience death and medical complications, whereas females were more likely to face wound-related surgical complications. At the institution level, females more often experience NRD and longer hospital stays. These findings may better inform preoperative expectation management and provide more detailed postoperative risk assessments based on the patient's gender.",

            "chunk": "Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is characterized by insulin deficiency and blood sugar control issues. The state-of-the-art solution is the artificial pancreas (AP), which integrates basal insulin delivery and glucose monitoring. However, APs are unable to manage postprandial glucose response (PGR) due to limited knowledge of its determinants, requiring additional information for accurate bolus delivery, such as estimated carbohydrate intake. This study aims to quantify the influence of various meal-related factors on predicting postprandial blood glucose levels (BGLs) at different time intervals (15 min, 60 min, and 120 min) after meals by using deep neural network (DNN) models. The prediction models incorporate preprandial blood glucose values, insulin dosage, and various meal-related nutritional factors such as intake of energy, carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, fatty acids, fibers, glycemic index, and glycemic load as input variables. The impact of input features was assessed by exploiting eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methodologies, specifically SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), which provide insights into each feature's contribution to the model predictions. By leveraging XAI methodologies, this study aims to enhance the interpretability and transparency of BGL prediction models and validate clinical literature hypotheses. The findings can aid in the development of decision-support tools for individuals with T1DM, facilitating PGR management and reducing the risks of adverse events. The improved understanding of PGR determinants may lead to advancements in AP technology and improve the overall quality of life for T1DM patients.",

            "chunk": "Medical imaging is a key component in clinical diagnosis, treatment planning and clinical trial design, accounting for almost 90% of all healthcare data. CNNs achieved performance gains in medical image analysis (MIA) over the last years. CNNs can efficiently model local pixel interactions and be trained on small-scale MI data. Despite their important advances, typical CNN have relatively limited capabilities in modelling \"global\" pixel interactions, which restricts their generalisation ability to understand out-of-distribution data with different \"global\" information. The recent progress of Artificial Intelligence gave rise to Transformers, which can learn global relationships from data. However, full Transformer models need to be trained on large-scale data and involve tremendous computational complexity. Attention and Transformer compartments (\"Transf/Attention\") which can well maintain properties for modelling global relationships, have been proposed as lighter alternatives of full Transformers. Recently, there is an increasing trend to co-pollinate complementary local-global properties from CNN and Transf/Attention architectures, which led to a new era of hybrid models. The past years have witnessed substantial growth in hybrid CNN-Transf/Attention models across diverse MIA problems. In this systematic review, we survey existing hybrid CNN-Transf/Attention models, review and unravel key architectural designs, analyse breakthroughs, and evaluate current and future opportunities as well as challenges. We also introduced an analysis framework on generalisation opportunities of scientific and clinical impact, based on which new data-driven domain generalisation and adaptation methods can be stimulated.",

METHOD: Twenty-three adults with aphasia resulting from left-hemispheric stroke and 23 adults matched for age and educational level completed a series of six nonlinguistic cognitive tests measuring nonverbal intelligence, short-term memory, visual selective attention, visual alternating attention, auditory selective attention, and auditory alternating attention. A standardized aphasia assessment (Concise Chinese Aphasia Test [CCAT]) was also conducted to evaluate the severity of aphasia. Data analyses examined cognitive functions by comparing task performance of the two groups and examining the relationship between scores on the cognitive tasks and aphasia severity based on a hierarchical regression analysis. RESULTS: The aphasia group scored significantly lower than the control group on all nonlinguistic cognitive tasks with large effect sizes (d = 0.95 ~ 1.54). Significant associations between different nonlinguistic cognitive tasks and CCAT subtests were observed. Results from the hierarchical regression analysis showed that auditory alternating attention was the only factor that significantly predicted aphasia severity based on CCAT overall scores after age and education level were taken into account. CONCLUSIONS: The findings align with prior research observing deficits in nonlinguistic cognition in individuals with aphasia. Implications for clinical practice and future research are discussed.",

However, it is unclear whether large linguistic models can rival specialized models by text alone. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we explored the performance of ChatGPT for primary screening of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and standardized the design steps and components of the prompts. METHODS: We gathered a total of 174 participants from the DementiaBank screening and classified 70% of them into the training set and 30% of them into the test set. Only text dialogues were kept. Sentences were cleaned using a macro code, followed by a manual check. The prompt consisted of 5 main parts, including character setting, scoring system setting, indicator setting, output setting, and explanatory information setting. Three dimensions of variables from published studies were included: vocabulary (ie, word frequency and word ratio, phrase frequency and phrase ratio, and lexical complexity), syntax and grammar (ie, syntactic complexity and grammatical components), and semantics (ie, semantic density and semantic coherence). We used R 4.3.0. for the analysis of variables and diagnostic indicators. RESULTS: Three additional indicators related to the severity of MCI were incorporated into the final prompt for the model. These indicators were effective in discriminating between MCI and cognitively normal participants: tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon (P<.001), difficulty with complex ideas (P<.001), and memory issues (P<.001). The final GPT-4 model achieved a sensitivity of 0.8636, a specificity of 0.9487, and an area under the curve of 0.9062 on the training set; on the test set, the sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve reached 0.7727, 0.8333, and 0.8030, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: ChatGPT was effective in the primary screening of participants with possible MCI. Improved standardization of prompts by clinicians would also improve the performance of the model. It is important to note that ChatGPT is not a substitute for a clinician making a diagnosis.",

Although MS is a rare condition in pediatric age, an increasing rate of patients is diagnosed under the age of 18. The disabling nature of the disease cannot be reduced only to physical symptoms. Several additional symptoms such as cognitive impairment, fatigue, and psychological symptoms are common features of pediatric MS. The reviewed literature suggests that, despite the lower physical disability, children and adolescents diagnosed with MS are vulnerable to cognitive impairment even in the early stage of the disease. The neuropsychological profile of pediatric MS may resemble that of adult MS, including an impairment in attention/information processing speed, learning, verbal, and visuospatial memory. However, cognitive difficulties in children and adolescents are more likely to involve also general intelligence and linguistic abilities, presumably due to patients' younger age and cognitive growth stage. Cognitive difficulties, beyond physical disability and relapses, may have a considerable impact on learning and school achievement. Depression and fatigue are other highly prevalent disturbances in pediatric MS and may contribute to patients' low functional outcomes. Overall, these manifestations may cause considerable functional impairment on daily activities and quality of life that may require individualized rehabilitative treatment and extensive psychosocial care. Additional neuropsychological research evaluating larger samples, using more homogenous methods, and exploring the role of MS treatment on cognitive and psychological development is required.",

Within the records, CT scans contain phenotypic data which have significant prognostic value. However, data extractions have not traditionally been applied to imaging data. In this study, we utilized artificial intelligence to automate biomarker extraction from CT scans and examined the value of these features in improving risk prediction in patients with liver disease. APPROACH: Using a regional liver disease cohort from the Veterans Health System, we retrieved administrative, laboratory and clinical data for Veterans who had CT scans performed for any clinical indication between 2008 to 2014. Imaging biomarkers were automatically derived using the analytic morphomics platform. RESULTS: 4614 patients were included. We found that the electronic Child Turcotte Pugh Score had a Concordance-index of 0.64 for the prediction of overall mortality while the imaging based model alone or with electronic Child Turcotte Pugh Score performed significantly better, Concordance-index of 0.72 and 0.73 (p<0.001). For the subset of patients without hepatic decompensation at baseline (n=4452), the Concordance-index for predicting future decompensation was 0.67, 0.79 and 0.80 for electronic Child Turcotte Pugh Score , imaging alone or combined respectively. CONCLUSION: This proof of concept demonstrates the potential of utilizing automated extraction of imaging features within CT scans either alone or in conjunction with classic health data can improve risk prediction in patients with chronic liver disease.",

            "chunk": "The hippocampus is a complex brain structure that plays an important role in various cognitive aspects such as memory, intelligence, executive function, and path integration. The volume of this highly plastic structure is identified as one of the most important biomarkers of specific neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases. It has also been extensively investigated in numerous aging studies. However, recent studies on aging show that the performance of conventional approaches in measuring the hippocampal volume is still far from satisfactory, especially in terms of delivering longitudinal measures from ultra-high field magnetic resonance images (MRIs), which can visualize more boundary details. The advancement of deep learning provides an alternative solution to measuring the hippocampal volume. In this work, we comprehensively compared a deep learning pipeline based on nnU-Net with several conventional approaches including Freesurfer, FSL and DARTEL, for automatically delivering hippocampal volumes: (1) Firstly, we evaluated the segmentation accuracy and precision on a public dataset through cross-validation. Results showed that the deep learning pipeline had the lowest mean (L = 1.5%, R = 1.7%) and the lowest standard deviation (L = 5.2%, R = 6.2%) in terms of volume percentage error. (2) Secondly, sub-millimeter MRIs of a group of healthy adults with test-retest 3T and 7T sessions were used to extensively assess the test-retest reliability. Results showed that the deep learning pipeline achieved very high intraclass correlation coefficients (L = 0.990, R = 0.986 for 7T; L = 0.985, R = 0.983 for 3T) and very small volume percentage differences (L = 1.2%, R = 0.9% for 7T; L = 1.3%, R = 1.3% for 3T). (3) Thirdly, a Bayesian linear mixed effect model was constructed with respect to the hippocampal volumes of two healthy adult datasets with longitudinal 7T scans and one disease-related longitudinal dataset. It was found that the deep learning pipeline detected both the subtle and disease-related changes over time with high sensitivity as well as the mild differences across subjects. Comparison results from the aforementioned three aspects showed that the deep learning pipeline significantly outperformed the conventional approaches by large margins. Results also showed that the deep learning pipeline can better accommodate longitudinal analysis purposes.",

Managing pancreatic cancer remains a challenge despite significant advancements in diagnosis and treatment. AI has secured an almost ubiquitous presence in the field of oncological workup and management, especially in gastroenterology malignancies. AI is particularly useful for various investigations of pancreatic carcinoma because it has specific radiological features that enable diagnostic procedures without the requirement of a histological study. However, interpreting and evaluating resulting images is not always simple since images vary as the disease progresses. Secondly, a number of factors may impact prognosis and response to the treatment process.

            "chunk": "Background Eagle's syndrome is characterized by the anomalous elongation of the styloid process. This condition is usually identified through the manual evaluation of orthopantomogram (OPG) images, which is time-consuming and can have interobserver variability. The application of Artificial intelligence (AI) in radiology is gaining importance and interest in recent years. The application of AI in detecting styloid process elongation is less explored, advocating for research in the same arena. Aim and objectives The study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of artificial intelligence in detecting styloid process elongation in digital OPGs and to compare the performance of the three different AI algorithms with that of the manual radiographic evaluation by the radiologist. Materials and methods A total of 400 digital OPGs were screened, and linear measurements of the styloid process length (ImageJ software (National Institute of Health, Maryland, USA)) were done for the identification of styloid process elongation by a single calibrated observer to finally include a processed image dataset including 169 images of the elongated styloid process and 200 images of the normal styloid process. A machine learning approach was used to detect the styloid process elongation using the three different AI models: logistic regression, neural network, and Naive Bayes algorithms in Orange software (University of Ljubljana, Slovenia). Performance evaluation was done using the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC (area under the receiver operating characteristic) curve. Results Logistic regression and neural network algorithms depicted the highest accuracy of 100% with no false positives or false negatives, securing a score of 1.000 for all the metrics. However, the Naive Bayes model demonstrated a fairly considerable accuracy, classifying 49 false positive images and 59 false negative images with an AUC (area under the curve) score of 78 %. Nevertheless, it performed better than random guessing. Conclusion Logistic regression and neural network algorithms accurately detected styloid process elongation similar to that of manual radiographic evaluation. The Naive Bayes algorithm did not perform an accurate classification yet performed better than random guessing. AI holds a promising scope for its application in automatically detecting styloid process elongation in digital OPGs.",

            "chunk": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: It is important to diagnose cerebral infarction at an early stage and select an appropriate treatment method. The number of stroke-trained physicians is unevenly distributed; thus, a shortage of specialists is a major problem in some regions. In this retrospective design study, we tested whether an artificial intelligence (AI) we built using computer-aided detection/diagnosis may help medical physicians to classify stroke for the appropriate treatment. METHODS: To build the Stroke Classification and Treatment Support System AI, the clinical data of 231 hospitalized patients with ischemic stroke from January 2016 to December 2017 were used for training the AI. To verify the diagnostic accuracy, 151 patients who were admitted for stroke between January 2018 and December 2018 were also enrolled. RESULTS: By utilizing multimodal data, such as DWI and ADC map images, as well as patient examination data, we were able to construct an AI that can explain the analysis results with a small amount of training data. Furthermore, the AI was able to classify with high accuracy (Cohort 1, evaluation data 88.7%; Cohort 2, validation data 86.1%). CONCLUSION: In recent years, the treatment options for cerebral infarction have increased in number and complexity, making it even more important to provide appropriate treatment according to the initial diagnosis. This system could be used for initial treatment to automatically diagnose and classify strokes in hospitals where stroke-trained physicians are not available and improve the prognosis of cerebral infarction.",

We combined computed tomography (CT) and artificial intelligence (AI) to measure BMD and explore its impact on traumatic rib fractures and their patterns. METHODS: The retrospective cohort comprised patients who visited our hospital from 2017-2018; the prospective cohort (control group) was consecutively recruited from the same hospital from February-June 2023. All patients had blunt chest trauma and underwent CT. Volumetric BMD of L1 vertebra was measured by using an AI software. Analyses were done by using BMD categorized as osteoporosis (<80 mg/cm3), osteopenia (80-120 mg/cm3), or normal (>120 mg/cm3). Pearson's chi2, Fisher's exact, or Kruskal-Wallis tests and Bonferroni correction were used for comparisons. Negative binomial, and logistic regression analyses were used to assess the associations and impacts of BMD status. Sensitivity analyses were also performed. FINDINGS: The retrospective cohort included 2,076 eligible patients, of whom 954 (46%) had normal BMD, 806 (38.8%) had osteopenia, and 316 (15.2%) had osteoporosis. After sex- and age-adjustment, osteoporosis was significantly associated with higher rib fracture rates, and a higher likelihood of fractures in ribs 4-7. Furthermore, both the osteopenia and osteoporosis groups demonstrated a significantly higher number of fractured ribs and fracture sites on ribs, with a higher likelihood of fractures in ribs 1-3, as well as flail chest. The prospective cohort included 205 eligible patients, of whom 92 (44.9%) had normal BMD, 74 (36.1%) had osteopenia, and 39 (19.0%) had osteoporosis. The findings observed within this cohort were in concurrence with those in the retrospective cohort. INTERPRETATION: Traumatic rib fractures are associated with decreased BMD. CT-AI can help to identify individuals who have decreased BMD and a greater rib fracture rate, along with their fracture patterns.",

This retrospective, multicenter study included 155 patients (artificial intelligence training cohort [n = 99], validation cohort [n = 56]) who underwent surgery for small-diameter (</=40 mm) renal tumors, with the pathological diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma, during 2010-2020. We created a learned deep neural networks using pix2pix. We examined the quality of the synthetic enhanced computed tomography images created using this deep neural networks and compared them with real enhanced computed tomography images using the zero-mean normalized cross-correlation parameter. We assessed concordance rates between real and synthetic images and diagnoses according to 10 urologists by creating a receiver operating characteristic curve and calculating the area under the curve. The synthetic computed tomography images were highly concordant with the real computed tomography images, regardless of the existence or morphology of the renal tumor. Regarding the concordance rate, a greater area under the curve was obtained with synthetic computed tomography (area under the curve = 0.892) than with only computed tomography (area under the curve = 0.720; p < 0.001). In conclusions, this study is the first to use deep neural networks to create a high-quality synthetic computed tomography image that was highly concordant with a real computed tomography image. Our synthetic computed tomography images could be used for urological diagnoses and clinical screening.",

            "chunk": "Chronic low back pain (LBP) is influenced by a broad spectrum of patient-specific factors as codified in domains of the biopsychosocial model (BSM). Operationalizing the BSM into research and clinical care is challenging because most investigators work in silos that concentrate on only one or two BSM domains. Furthermore, the expanding, multidisciplinary nature of BSM research creates practical limitations as to how individual investigators integrate current data into their processes of generating impactful hypotheses. The rapidly advancing field of artificial intelligence (AI) is providing new tools for organizing knowledge, but the practical aspects for how AI may advance LBP research and clinical are beginning to be explored. The goals of the work presented here are to: (1) explore the current capabilities of knowledge integration technologies (large language models (LLM), similarity graphs (SGs), and knowledge graphs (KGs)) to synthesize biomedical literature and depict multimodal relationships reflected in the BSM, and; (2) highlight limitations, implementation details, and future areas of research to improve performance. We demonstrate preliminary evidence that LLMs, like GPT-3, may be useful in helping scientists analyze and distinguish cLBP publications across multiple BSM domains and determine the degree to which the literature supports or contradicts emergent hypotheses. We show that SG representations and KGs enable exploring LBP's literature in novel ways, possibly providing, trans-disciplinary perspectives or insights that are currently difficult, if not infeasible to achieve. The SG approach is automated, simple, and inexpensive to execute, and thereby may be useful for early-phase literature and narrative explorations beyond one's areas of expertise. Likewise, we show that KGs can be constructed using automated pipelines, queried to provide semantic information, and analyzed to explore trans-domain linkages. The examples presented support the feasibility for LBP-tailored AI protocols to organize knowledge and support developing and refining trans-domain hypotheses.",

Despite evidence of the beneficial effects of music, the acoustic features that make music effective in therapeutic contexts remain elusive. AIMS: This study aimed to identify and validate distinctive acoustic features of healing music. METHODS: We constructed a healing music dataset (HMD) based on nominations from related professionals and extracted 370 acoustic features. Healing-distinctive acoustic features were identified as those that were (1) independent from genre within the HMD, (2) significantly different from music pieces in a classical music dataset (CMD) and (3) similar to pieces in a five-element music dataset (FEMD). We validated the identified features by comparing jazz pieces in the HMD with a jazz music dataset (JMD). We also examined the emotional properties of the features in a Chinese affective music system (CAMS). RESULTS: The HMD comprised 165 pieces. Among all the acoustic features, 74.59% shared commonalities across genres, and 26.22% significantly differed between the HMD classical pieces and the CMD. The equivalence test showed that the HMD and FEMD did not differ significantly in 9.46% of the features. The potential healing-distinctive acoustic features were identified as the standard deviation of the roughness, mean and period entropy of the third coefficient of the mel-frequency cepstral coefficients. In a three-dimensional space defined by these features, HMD's jazz pieces could be distinguished from those of the JMD. These three features could significantly predict both subjective valence and arousal ratings in the CAMS. CONCLUSIONS: The distinctive acoustic features of healing music that have been identified and validated in this study have implications for the development of artificial intelligence models for identifying therapeutic music, particularly in contexts where access to professional expertise may be limited. This study contributes to the growing body of research exploring the potential of digital technologies for healthcare interventions.",

Crossmatching for complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing are two important methods for checking graft compatibility and reducing the risk of graft rejection. HLA typing and CDC crossmatching are critical in kidney, heart, lung, liver, pancreas, intestine, and multi-organ transplantation. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted on the internet, using PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases, to identify peer-reviewed publications about solid organ transplants, HLA typing, and CDC crossmatching. CONCLUSION: Recent advances in HLA typing have allowed for high-resolution evaluation, epitope matching, and personalized therapy methods. Genomic profiling, next-generation sequencing, and artificial intelligence have improved HLA typing precision, resulting in better patient outcomes. Artificial intelligence (AI) driven virtual crossmatching and predictive algorithms have eliminated the requirement for physical crossmatching in the context of CDC crossmatching, boosting organ allocation and transplant efficiency.

By altering image attributes to produce analogous images that elicit a different prediction by the classifiers, and by asking physicians to identify medically meaningful features in the images, the counterfactual images revealed that the classifiers rely both on features used by human dermatologists, such as lesional pigmentation patterns, and on undesirable features, such as background skin texture and colour balance.

In this study, we aim at designing an artificial intelligence that can efficiently predict the progression of gait quality using kinematic data obtained from QGA. For this purpose, a gait database collected from 734 patients with gait disorders is used. As the patient walks, kinematic data is collected during the gait session. This data is processed to generate the Gait Profile Score (GPS) for each gait cycle. Tracking potential GPS variations enables detecting changes in gait quality. In this regard, our work is driven by predicting such future variations. Two approaches were considered: signal-based and image-based. The signal-based one uses raw gait cycles, while the image-based one employs a two-dimensional Fast Fourier Transform (2D FFT) representation of gait cycles. Several architectures were developed, and the obtained Area Under the Curve (AUC) was above 0.72 for both approaches. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to apply neural networks for gait prediction tasks.",

In the past few decades' neural mechanisms of pain regulation and perception have been clarified by neuroimaging research. Advances in the neuroimaging have bridged the gap between brain activity and the subjective experience of pain. Neuroimaging has also made strides toward separating the neural mechanisms underlying the chronic painful TMD. Recently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming various sectors by automating tasks that previously required humans' intelligence to complete. AI has started to contribute to the recognition, assessment, and understanding of painful TMD. The application of AI and neuroimaging in understanding the pathophysiology and diagnosis of chronic painful TMD are still in its early stages. The objective of the present review is to identify the contemporary neuroimaging approaches such as structural, functional, and molecular techniques that have been used to investigate the brain of chronic painful TMD individuals. Furthermore, this review guides practitioners on relevant aspects of AI and how AI and neuroimaging methods can revolutionize our understanding on the mechanisms of painful TMD and aid in both diagnosis and management to enhance patient outcomes.",

OBJECTIVE: To use artificial intelligence (AI) analysis of erythrocyte morphology and machine learning (ML) to identify TT gene carriers in a non-anemic population. METHODS: Digital morphological data from 76 TT gene carriers and 97 controls were collected. The AI technology-based Mindray MC-100i was used to quantitatively analyze the percentage of abnormal erythrocytes. Further, ML was used to construct a prediction model. RESULTS: Non-anemic TT carriers accounted for over 60% of the TT cases. Random Forest was selected as the prediction model and named TT@Normal. The TT@Normal algorithm showed outstanding performance in the training, validation, and external validation sets and could efficiently identify TT carriers in the non-anemic population. The top three weights in the TT@Normal model were the target cells, microcytes, and teardrop cells. Elevated percentages of abnormal erythrocytes should raise a strong suspicion of being a TT gene carrier. TT@Normal could be promoted and used as a visualization and sharing tool. It is accessible through a URL link and can be used by medical staff online to predict the possibility of TT gene carriage in a non-anemic population. CONCLUSIONS: The ML-based model TT@Normal could efficiently identify TT carriers in non-anemic people.

While early identification and management of frailty may limit adverse health outcomes, the complex presentations of frailty pose challenges for clinicians. Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a potential solution to support the early identification and management of frailty. In order to provide a comprehensive overview of current evidence regarding the development and use of AI technologies including machine learning and deep learning for the identification and management of frailty, this protocol outlines a scoping review aiming to identify and present available information in this area. Specifically, this protocol describes a review that will focus on the clinical tools and frameworks used to assess frailty, the outcomes that have been evaluated and the involvement of knowledge users in the development, implementation and evaluation of AI methods and tools for frailty care in clinical settings. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This scoping review protocol details a systematic search of eight major academic databases, including Medline, Embase, PsycInfo, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Ageline, Web of Science, Scopus and Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Xplore using the framework developed by Arksey and O'Malley and enhanced by Levac et al and the Joanna Briggs Institute. The search strategy has been designed in consultation with a librarian. Two independent reviewers will screen titles and abstracts, followed by full texts, for eligibility and then chart the data using a piloted data charting form. Results will be collated and presented through a narrative summary, tables and figures. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Since this study is based on publicly available information, ethics approval is not required. Findings will be communicated with healthcare providers, caregivers, patients and research and health programme funders through peer-reviewed publications, presentations and an infographic.

However, the implementation of AI in clinical practice needs to be evaluated against the existing methods. This study is aimed at assessing the optimal method of using AI-based mitotic figure scoring in breast cancer (BC). We utilized whole slide images from a large cohort of BC with extended follow-up comprising a discovery (n = 1715) and a validation (n = 859) set (Nottingham cohort). The Cancer Genome Atlas of breast invasive carcinoma (TCGA-BRCA) cohort (n = 757) was used as an external test set. Employing automated mitosis detection, the mitotic count was assessed using 3 different methods, the mitotic count per tumor area (MCT; calculated by dividing the number of mitotic figures by the total tumor area), the mitotic index (MI; defined as the average number of mitotic figures per 1000 malignant cells), and the mitotic activity index (MAI; defined as the number of mitotic figures in 3 mm(2) area within the mitotic hotspot). These automated metrics were evaluated and compared based on their correlation with the well-established visual scoring method of the Nottingham grading system and Ki67 score, clinicopathologic parameters, and patient outcomes. AI-based mitotic scores derived from the 3 methods (MCT, MI, and MAI) were significantly correlated with the clinicopathologic characteristics and patient survival (P < .001). However, the mitotic counts and the derived cutoffs varied significantly between the 3 methods. Only MAI and MCT were positively correlated with the gold standard visual scoring method used in Nottingham grading system (r = 0.8 and r = 0.7, respectively) and Ki67 scores (r = 0.69 and r = 0.55, respectively), and MAI was the only independent predictor of survival (P < .05) in multivariate Cox regression analysis. For clinical applications, the optimum method of scoring mitosis using AI needs to be considered. MAI can provide reliable and reproducible results and can accurately quantify mitotic figures in BC.",

The incremental learning scheme should also be well considered. However, existing methods have certain limitations in dealing with such issues. In this article, a dynamic model interpretation-guided online active learning scheme, termed a dynamic model interpretation-guided learning scheme (DMI-LS), is proposed. Specifically, the model update strategy with chunk data is designed based on the implementation of the broad learning system. A novel query strategy is then investigated to consider the ranking preference difference, which relies on the interpretation generated by the explainable artificial intelligence method. Several experiments based on the JiaoLong deep-sea manned submersible data are conducted to verify the effects of the proposed DMI-LS. The results show that it outperforms the other advanced existing approaches with different settings in most scenarios.",

OBJECTIVE: This study is among the first on responsible artificial intelligence-generated content in medicine. We focus on analyzing the differences between medical texts written by human experts and those generated by ChatGPT and designing machine learning workflows to effectively detect and differentiate medical texts generated by ChatGPT. METHODS: We first constructed a suite of data sets containing medical texts written by human experts and generated by ChatGPT. We analyzed the linguistic features of these 2 types of content and uncovered differences in vocabulary, parts-of-speech, dependency, sentiment, perplexity, and other aspects. Finally, we designed and implemented machine learning methods to detect medical text generated by ChatGPT. The data and code used in this paper are published on GitHub. RESULTS: Medical texts written by humans were more concrete, more diverse, and typically contained more useful information, while medical texts generated by ChatGPT paid more attention to fluency and logic and usually expressed general terminologies rather than effective information specific to the context of the problem. A bidirectional encoder representations from transformers-based model effectively detected medical texts generated by ChatGPT, and the F(1) score exceeded 95%. CONCLUSIONS: Although text generated by ChatGPT is grammatically perfect and human-like, the linguistic characteristics of generated medical texts were different from those written by human experts. Medical text generated by ChatGPT could be effectively detected by the proposed machine learning algorithms.

            "chunk": "BACKGROUND: Refractive surgery research aims to optimally precategorize patients by their suitability for various types of surgery. Recent advances have led to the development of artificial intelligence-powered algorithms, including machine learning approaches, to assess risks and enhance workflow. Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT-4 (OpenAI LP) have emerged as potential general artificial intelligence tools that can assist across various disciplines, possibly including refractive surgery decision-making. However, their actual capabilities in precategorizing refractive surgery patients based on real-world parameters remain unexplored. OBJECTIVE: This exploratory study aimed to validate ChatGPT-4's capabilities in precategorizing refractive surgery patients based on commonly used clinical parameters. The goal was to assess whether ChatGPT-4's performance when categorizing batch inputs is comparable to those made by a refractive surgeon. A simple binary set of categories (patient suitable for laser refractive surgery or not) as well as a more detailed set were compared. METHODS: Data from 100 consecutive patients from a refractive clinic were anonymized and analyzed. Parameters included age, sex, manifest refraction, visual acuity, and various corneal measurements and indices from Scheimpflug imaging. This study compared ChatGPT-4's performance with a clinician's categorizations using Cohen kappa coefficient, a chi-square test, a confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, F(1)-score, and receiver operating characteristic area under the curve. RESULTS: A statistically significant noncoincidental accordance was found between ChatGPT-4 and the clinician's categorizations with a Cohen kappa coefficient of 0.399 for 6 categories (95% CI 0.256-0.537) and 0.610 for binary categorization (95% CI 0.372-0.792). The model showed temporal instability and response variability, however. The chi-square test on 6 categories indicated an association between the 2 raters' distributions (chi(2)(5)=94.7, P<.001). Here, the accuracy was 0.68, precision 0.75, recall 0.68, and F(1)-score 0.70. For 2 categories, the accuracy was 0.88, precision 0.88, recall 0.88, F(1)-score 0.88, and area under the curve 0.79. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that ChatGPT-4 exhibits potential as a precategorization tool in refractive surgery, showing promising agreement with clinician categorizations. However, its main limitations include, among others, dependency on solely one human rater, small sample size, the instability and variability of ChatGPT's (OpenAI LP) output between iterations and nontransparency of the underlying models. The results encourage further exploration into the application of LLMs like ChatGPT-4 in health care, particularly in decision-making processes that require understanding vast clinical data. Future research should focus on defining the model's accuracy with prompt and vignette standardization, detecting confounding factors, and comparing to other versions of ChatGPT-4 and other LLMs to pave the way for larger-scale validation and real-world implementation.",

The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) in health care offers solutions to these challenges. AI, a multidisciplinary field, enhances clinical decision-making. However, imbalanced AI models may enhance health disparities. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aims to investigate the economic performance and equity impact of AI in diagnostic imaging for skin, neurological, and pulmonary diseases. The research question is \"To what extent does the use of AI in imaging exams for diagnosing skin, neurological, and pulmonary diseases result in improved economic outcomes, and does it promote equity in health care systems?\" METHODS: The study is a systematic review of economic and equity evaluations following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) and CHEERS (Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards) guidelines. Eligibility criteria include articles reporting on economic evaluations or equity considerations related to AI-based diagnostic imaging for specified diseases. Data will be collected from PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and reference lists. Data quality and transferability will be assessed according to CHEC (Consensus on Health Economic Criteria), EPHPP (Effective Public Health Practice Project), and Welte checklists. RESULTS: This systematic review began in March 2023. The literature search identified 9,526 publications and, after full-text screening, 9 publications were included in the study. We plan to submit a manuscript to a peer-reviewed journal once it is finalized, with an expected completion date in January 2024. CONCLUSIONS: AI in diagnostic imaging offers potential benefits but also raises concerns about equity and economic impact. Bias in algorithms and disparities in access may hinder equitable outcomes. Evaluating the economic viability of AI applications is essential for resource allocation and affordability. Policy makers and health care stakeholders can benefit from this review's insights to make informed decisions. Limitations, including study variability and publication bias, will be considered in the analysis. This systematic review will provide valuable insights into the economic and equity implications of AI in diagnostic imaging. It aims to inform evidence-based decision-making and contribute to more efficient and equitable health care systems. INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID): DERR1-10.2196/48544.",

Methods: This retrospective analysis of systematically recorded clinical parameters in youth hospitalized for psychiatric treatment in 2004-2015 assessed magnitude and correlates of symptom response (SR), global illness response (GIR), social functioning (SF), out-of-home placement (OOHP), and length of stay (LOS). Backward elimination regression analyses were performed to identify independent baseline correlates of each of the 5 outcomes, with R(2) representing the variance explained by the independent correlates retained in the final model. Results: Across 1,189 youth (median age = 14.4 years; interquartile range = 11.6,16.1 years; range, 5-19 years; females = 61.5%), frequencies of coprimary outcomes were as follows: SR = 57.5% (statistically significant correlates = 13, R(2) = 0.154), GIR = 30.0% (correlates = 5, R(2) = 0.078), SF = 19.0% (correlates = 8, R(2) = 0.207), OOHP recommendation = 35.2% (correlates = 13, R(2) = 0.275), and mean +/- SD LOS = 65.0 +/- 37.5 days (correlates = 11, R(2) = 0.219). In multivariable analyses, 11 factors were statistically significantly (P < .05) associated with > 1 poor outcome: 4 with 4 outcomes (disturbed social interaction, substance abuse/dependence symptoms; sole exception for both = LOS; disturbed drive/attention/impulse control, sole exception = OOHP; higher admission BMI percentile [but shorter LOS], sole exception = GIR), 3 with 3 outcomes (higher admission age [but good SF and shorter LOS], more abnormal psychosocial circumstances, more mental health diagnoses), and 4 with 2 outcomes (intelligence level [IQ] < 85, obsessive-compulsive disorder symptoms, disturbed social behavior, somatic findings). Additionally, 17 correlates were statistically significantly (P < .05) associated with 1 outcome, ie, SR = 6, OOHP = 5, LOS = 5, SF = 1. Conclusions: Higher admission BMI percentile, disturbed social interaction, disturbed drive/attention/impulse control, and substance abuse/dependence symptoms were independently associated with multiple poor outcomes in mentally ill youth requiring inpatient care.

Multiscale mechanistic computational models of cardiac electrophysiology provide precise control over individual parameters, and their reproducibility enables a thorough assessment of arrhythmia mechanisms. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of models of cardiac electrophysiology and arrhythmias. from the single cell to the organ level, and how they can be leveraged to better understand rhythm disorders in cardiac disease and to improve heart patient care. Key issues related to model development based on experimental data are discussed and major families of human cardiomyocyte models and their applications are highlighted. An overview of organ-level computational modeling of cardiac electrophysiology and its clinical applications in personalized arrhythmia risk assessment and patient-specific therapy of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias is provided. The advancements presented here highlight how patient-specific computational models of the heart reconstructed from patient clinical data have achieved success in predicting risk of sudden cardiac death and guiding optimal treatments of heart rhythm disorders. Finally, an outlook towards potential future advances, including the combination of mechanistic modeling and machine learning / artificial intelligence, is provided. As the field of cardiology is embarking on a journey towards precision medicine, personalized modeling of the heart is expected to become a key technology to guide pharmaceutical therapy, deployment of devices, and surgical interventions.",

METHODS: This study used a cross-sectional design for collecting data related to the perceptions and readiness of hematologists using a validated online questionnaire-based survey. Both hematologists (MD) and postgraduate MD students in hematology were included in the study. A total of 188 participants, including 35 hematologists (MD) and 153 MD hematology students, completed the survey. RESULTS: Major challenges include \"AI's level of autonomy\" and \"the complexity in the field of medicine.\" Major barriers and risks identified include \"lack of trust,\" \"management's level of understanding,\" \"dehumanization of healthcare,\" and \"reduction in physicians' skills.\" Statistically significant differences in perceptions of benefits including resources (p=0.0326, p<0.05) and knowledge (p=0.0262, p<0.05) were observed between genders. Older physicians were observed to be more concerned about the use of AI compared to younger physicians (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: While AI use in hematology diagnosis and treatment decision-making is positively perceived, issues such as lack of trust, transparency, regulations, and poor AI awareness can affect the adoption of AI.",

            "chunk-id": 1,
            "chunk": "BACKGROUND: Middle-aged and older adults frequently experience hearing loss and a decline in cognitive function. Although an association between hearing difficulty and cognitive function has been demonstrated, its temporal sequence remains unclear. Therefore, we investigated whether there are bidirectional relationships between hearing difficulty and cognitive function and explored the mediating role of depressive symptoms in this relationship. METHOD: We used the cross-lagged panel model and the random-intercept cross-lagged panel model to look for any possible two-way link between self-reported hearing difficulty and cognitive function. To investigate depressive symptoms' role in this association, a mediation analysis was conducted. The sample was made up of 4,363 adults aged 45 and above from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS; 2011-2018; 44.83% were women; mean age was 56.16 years). One question was used to determine whether someone had a hearing impairment. The tests of cognitive function included episodic memory and intelligence. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, which consists of 10 items, was used to measure depressive symptoms. RESULTS: A bidirectional association between hearing and cognition was observed, with cognition predominating (Wald chi2 (1) = 7.241, p < 0.01). At the between-person level, after controlling for potential confounders, worse hearing in 2011 predicted worse cognitive function in 2013 (beta = -0.039, p < 0.01) and vice versa (beta = -0.041, p < 0.01) at the between-person level. Additionally, there was no corresponding cross-lagged effect of cognitive function on hearing difficulty; rather, the more hearing difficulty, the greater the cognitive decline at the within-person level. According to the cross-lagged mediation model, depressive symptoms partially mediates the impact of cognitive function on subsequent hearing difficulty (indirect effect: -0.003, bootstrap 95% confidence interval: -0.005, -0.001, p < 0.05), but not the other way around. CONCLUSION: These results showed that within-person relationships between hearing impairment and cognitive function were unidirectional, while between-person relationships were reciprocal. Setting mental health first may be able to break the vicious cycle that relates hearing loss to cognitive decline. Comprehensive long-term care requires services that address depressive symptoms and cognitive decline to be integrated with the hearing management.",

Sharing trained deep models not only facilitates knowledge integration in collaborative research efforts but also enables equitable access to computational intelligence. However, recent studies have shown that an adversary may leverage a shared model to learn the participation of a target individual in the training set. In this work, we investigate privacy-protecting model sharing for survival studies. Specifically, we pose three research questions. (1) Do deep survival models leak membership information? (2) How effective is differential privacy in defending against membership inference in deep survival analyses? (3) Are there other effects of differential privacy on deep survival analyses? Our study assesses the membership leakage in emerging deep survival models and develops differentially private training procedures to provide rigorous privacy protection. The experimental results show that deep survival models leak membership information and our approach effectively reduces membership inference risks. The results also show that differential privacy introduces a limited performance loss, and may improve the model robustness in the presence of noisy data, compared to non-private models.",

            "chunk": "Objective Emergence from anesthesia starts from the limbic structures and then spreads outwards to brainstem, reticular activating systems, and then to the cortex. Epilepsy surgery often involves resection of limbic structures and hence may disrupt the pattern of emergence. The aim of this study was to explore the pattern of emergence from anesthesia following epilepsy surgery and to determine associated variables affecting the emergence pattern. Setting and Design  Tertiary care center, prospective observational study. Materials   and Methods We conducted a prospective observation pilot study on adult patients undergoing anterior temporal lobectomy and amygdalohippocampectomy for epilepsy. Anesthesia management was standardized in all patients, and they were allowed to wake up with \"no touch\" technique. Primary outcome of the study was the pattern of emergence (normal emergence, agitated emergence, or slow emergence) from anesthesia. Secondary outcomes were to explore the differences in preoperative neuropsychological profile and limbic structure volumes between the different patterns of emergence. Quantitative variables were analyzed using Student's t -test. Qualitative variables were analyzed using chi-square test. Results  Twenty-nine patients completed the study: 9 patients (31%) had agitated emergence, and 20 patients had normal emergence. Among the agitated emergence, 2 patients had Riker scale of 7 indicating violent emergence. Patient demographics, anesthetic used, neuropsychological profile, and limbic structure volumes were similar between normal emergence and agitated emergence groups. However, two patients who had severe agitation (Riker scale of 7) had the lowest intelligence quotient. Conclusion  Our pilot study showed that emergence agitation is not uncommon in patients undergoing epilepsy surgery. However, due to smaller sample size, the role of preoperative neuropsychologic profile and hippocampal volumes in predicting the pattern of emergence is inconclusive.",

The use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) approaches on EMRs can further improve disease diagnosis, symptom classification, and support clinical decision-making. However, there are also challenges related to data quality, data entry errors, as well as the ethics and safety of using AI in healthcare. This article discusses the future of EMRs in gerontology and the application of AI and ML in clinical research.

Lifestyle-induced diseases currently account for a significant portion of all healthcare spending, with this proportion projected to increase with population aging. Wearable devices have emerged as a key technology for implementing large-scale healthcare systems focused on disease prevention and management. Advancements in miniaturized sensors, system integration, the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, 5G, and other technologies have enabled wearable devices to perform high-quality measurements comparable to medical devices. Through various physical, chemical, and biological sensors, wearable devices can continuously monitor physiological status information in a non-invasive or minimally invasive way, including electrocardiography, electroencephalography, respiration, blood oxygen, blood pressure, blood glucose, activity, and more. Furthermore, by combining concepts and methods from complex systems and nonlinear dynamics, we developed a novel theory of continuous dynamic physiological signal analysis-dynamical complexity. The results of dynamic signal analyses can provide crucial information for disease prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and management. Wearable devices can also serve as an important bridge connecting doctors and patients by tracking, storing, and sharing patient data with medical institutions, enabling remote or real-time health assessments of patients, and providing a basis for precision medicine and personalized treatment. Wearable devices have a promising future in the healthcare field and will be an important driving force for the transformation of the healthcare system, while also improving the health experience for individuals.",

We examined the AI platforms' performance by querying in Korean and English to determine their information amount, accuracy, and relevance in prompts in both languages. METHODS: From December 15 to 17, 2023, 6 generative AI platforms-Bard, Bing, Claude, Clova X, GPT-4, and Wrtn-were tested on 7 medical arthropodology learning objectives in English and Korean. Clova X and Wrtn are platforms from Korean companies. Responses were evaluated using specific criteria for the English and Korean queries. RESULTS: Bard had abundant information but was fourth in accuracy and relevance. GPT-4, with high information content, ranked first in accuracy and relevance. Clova X was 4th in amount but 2nd in accuracy and relevance. Bing provided less information, with moderate accuracy and relevance. Wrtn's answers were short, with average accuracy and relevance. Claude AI had reasonable information, but lower accuracy and relevance. The responses in English were superior in all aspects. Clova X was notably optimized for Korean, leading in relevance. CONCLUSION: In a study of 6 generative AI platforms applied to medical arthropodology, GPT-4 excelled overall, while Clova X, a Korea-based AI product, achieved 100% relevance in Korean queries, the highest among its peers. Utilizing these AI platforms in classrooms improved the authors' self-efficacy and interest in the subject, offering a positive experience of interacting with generative AI platforms to question and receive information.",

            "chunk": "OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the performance of artificial intelligence (AI) software in bone age (BA) assessment, according to the Greulich and Pyle (G&P) method in a German pediatric cohort. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hand radiographs of 306 pediatric patients aged 1-18 years (153 boys, 153 girls, 18 patients per year of life)-including a subgroup of patients in the age group for which the software is declared (243 patients)-were analyzed retrospectively. Two pediatric radiologists and one endocrinologist made independent blinded BA reads. Subsequently, AI software estimated BA from the same images. Both agreements, accuracy, and interchangeability between AI and expert readers were assessed. RESULTS: The mean difference between the average of three expert readers and AI software was 0.39 months with a mean absolute difference (MAD) of 6.8 months (1.73 months for the mean difference and 6.0 months for MAD in the intended use subgroup). Performance in boys was slightly worse than in girls (MAD 6.3 months vs. 5.6 months). Regression analyses showed constant bias (slope of 1.01 with a 95% CI 0.99-1.02). The estimated equivalence index for interchangeability was - 14.3 (95% CI -27.6 to - 1.1). CONCLUSION: In terms of BA assessment, the new AI software was interchangeable with expert readers using the G&P method. CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: The use of AI software enables every physician to provide expert reader quality in bone age assessment. KEY POINTS: * A novel artificial intelligence-based software for bone age estimation has not yet been clinically validated. * Artificial intelligence showed a good agreement and high accuracy with expert radiologists performing bone age assessment. * Artificial intelligence showed to be interchangeable with expert readers.",

            "chunk": "Accurate diagnosis of paediatric appendicitis remains a challenge due to its diverse clinical presentations and reliance on subjective assessments. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with an expert's ''clinical sense'' has the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the Artificial Intelligence Pediatric Appendicitis Decision-tree (AiPAD) model in enhancing the diagnostic capabilities of trainees and compare their performance with that of an expert supervisor. Between March 2019 and October 2022, we included paediatric patients aged 0-12 years who were referred for suspected appendicitis. Trainees collected clinical findings using five predefined parameters before ordering any imaging studies. The AiPAD model, which was blinded to the surgical team, made predictions from the supervisor's and trainees' findings independently. The diagnosis verdicts of the supervisor and the trainees were statistically evaluated in comparison to the prediction of the AI model, taking into account the revealed correct diagnosis. A total of 136 cases were included, comprising 58 cases of acute appendicitis (AA) and 78 cases of non-appendicitis (NA). The supervisor's correct verdict showed 91% accuracy compared to an average of 70% for trainees. However, if trainees were enabled with AiPAD, their accuracy would improve significantly to an average of 97%. Significantly, a strong association was observed between the expert's clinical sense and the predictions generated by AiPAD. CONCLUSION:  The utilisation of the AiPAD model in diagnosing paediatric appendicitis has significant potential to improve trainees' diagnostic accuracy, approaching the level of an expert supervisor. This hybrid approach combining AI and expert knowledge holds promise for enhancing diagnostic capabilities, reducing medical errors and improving patient outcomes. WHAT IS KNOWN: * Sharpening clinical judgement for pediatric appendicitis takes time and seasoned exposure. Traditional training leaves junior doctors yearning for a faster path to diagnostic mastery. WHAT IS NEW: * AI-generated models unlock the secrets of expert intuition, crafting an explicit guide for juniors to rapidly elevate their diagnostic skills. This leapfrog advancement empowers young doctors, democratizing medical expertise and paving the way for brighter outcomes in clinical training.",

The China Alliance of Research in High Myopia (CHARM) is a newly established consortium that includes more than 100 hospitals and institutions participating across the nation, aiming to promote collaboration and data sharing in the field of high myopia screening, classification, diagnosis and therapeutic development. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The CHARM project is an ongoing study, and its initiation is distinguished by its unprecedented scale, encompassing plans to involve over 100 000 Chinese patients. This initiative stands out not only for its extensive scope but also for its innovative application of artificial intelligence (AI) to assist in diagnosis and treatment decisions. The CHARM project has been carried out using a 'three-step' strategy. The first step involves the collection of basic information, refraction, axial length and fundus photographs from participants with high myopia. In the second step, we will collect multimodal imaging data to expand the scope of clinical information, for example, optical coherence tomography and ultra-widefield fundus images. In the final step, genetic testing will be conducted by incorporating patient family histories and blood samples. The majority of data collected by CHARM is in the form of images that will be used to detect and predict the progression of high myopia through the identification and quantification of biomarkers such as fundus tessellation, optic nerve head and vascular parameters. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has received approval from the Ethics Committee of Beijing Tongren Hospital (TREC2022-KY045). The establishment of CHARM represents an opportunity to create a collaborative platform for myopia experts and facilitate the dissemination of research findings to the global community through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations. These insights can inform clinical decision-making and contribute to the development of new treatment modalities that may benefit patients worldwide. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ChiCTR2300071219.",

According to the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) consortium, at least 171 million individuals were affected with AD in 2019, corresponding to 2.23% of the world population, with age-standardized prevalence and incidence rates that were relatively stable from 1990 to 2019. Based on the panel experience, most AD cases are mild-to-moderate. Without parallel data on disease prevalence and severity, the GBD data are difficult to interpret in many regions. This gap is particularly important in countries with limited medical infrastructure, but indirect evidence suggests a significant burden of AD in low-and-medium resource settings, especially urban areas. The Singapore roundtable was an opportunity to compare experiences in World Bank category 1 (Madagascar and Mali), 3 (Brazil, China) and 4 (Australia, Germany, Qatar, USA, Singapore, Japan) countries. The panel concluded that current AD guidelines are not adapted for low resource settings and a more pragmatic approach, as developed by WHO for skin NTDs, would be advisable for minimal access to moisturizers and topical corticosteroids. The panel also recommended prioritizing prevention studies, regardless of the level of existing resources. For disease long-term control in World Bank category 3 and most category 4 countries, the main problem is not access to drugs for most mild-to-moderate cases, but rather poor compliance due to insufficient time at visits. Collaboration with WHO, patient advocacy groups and industry may promote global change, improve capacity training and fight current inequalities. Finally, optimizing management of AD and its comorbidities needs more action at the primary care level, because reaching specialist care is merely aspirational in most settings. Primary care empowerment with store and forward telemedicine and algorithms based on augmented intelligence is a future goal.",

The cytopathology of the fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) serves as the baseline. MATERIAL AND METHODS: After securing IRB approval, a retrospective study was conducted, analyzing thyroid ultrasound images and FNAB results from 1,061 patients between January 2017 and January 2022. Detailed examinations of their demographic profiles, imaging characteristics, and cytological features were conducted. The images were used for training a deep learning model to identify various thyroid pathologies. ChatGPT assisted in developing this model by aiding in code writing, preprocessing, model optimization, and troubleshooting. RESULTS: The model demonstrated an accuracy of 0.81 on the testing set, within a 95% confidence interval of 0.76 to 0.87. It presented remarkable results across thyroid subgroups, particularly in the benign category, with high precision (0.78) and recall (0.96), yielding a balanced F1-score of 0.86. The malignant category also displayed high precision (0.82) and recall (0.92), with an F1-score of 0.87. CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrates the potential of artificial intelligence, particularly ChatGPT, in aiding the creation of robust deep learning models for medical image analysis.",

            "chunk": "BACKGROUND: Cerebral aneurysms are often identified and characterized on non-invasive CT Angiography (CTA) images, but digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is the gold standard for aneurysm evaluation. OBJECTIVE: We compared cerebral aneurysm size measurements as measured from CTA processed by a semi-automated artificial intelligence software program (RAPID Aneurysm) and three-dimensional rotational DSA (3D-DSA). METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of consecutive patients with a cerebral aneurysm who underwent CTA and DSA with 3D reformations. CTA images were processed by RAPID Aneurysm to determine aneurysm height, width, and neck width. The reference standard was aneurysm measurements on 3D-DSA as measured by two neurointerventionalists. Both readers were blinded to RAPID Aneurysm measurements. Correlation and bias between these measurements were determined. RESULTS: Results from 50 patients with 50 aneurysms were compared. 32 patients (64%) were female. Median age was 65 (IQR: 56.25-71.75). 37 patients (74%) presented with ruptured aneurysms. The aneurysms represented a range of aneurysm sizes (1.9-33.3 mm; IQR 3.6-7.2 mm). RAPID Aneurysm size measurements showed excellent correlation and low bias (correlation, mean difference) when compared to the reference standard for aneurysm height (0.98, -0.9 mm), width (0.98, 0.1 mm), and neck width (0.94, 1.1 mm). The inter-reader comparison between the two neurointerventionalists was similarly excellent for aneurysm height (0.97, -0.4 mm), width (0.98, -0.2 mm), and neck width (0.89, 0.8 mm). CONCLUSION: RAPID Aneurysm measurement of cerebral aneurysm height, width, and neck width on CTA is strongly correlated to expert neurointerventionalist measurements on 3D-DSA.",

This study aimed to predict PTB in a pregnant population using ML models, identify the key risk factors associated with PTB through the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) algorithm, and provide comprehensive explanations for these predictions to assist clinicians in providing appropriate care. This study analyzed a dataset of 3509 pregnant women in the United Arab Emirates and selected 35 risk factors associated with PTB based on the existing medical and artificial intelligence literature. Six ML algorithms were tested, wherein the XGBoost model exhibited the best performance, with an area under the operator receiving curves of 0.735 and 0.723 for parous and nulliparous women, respectively. The SHAP feature attribution framework was employed to identify the most significant risk factors linked to PTB. Additionally, individual patient analysis was performed using the SHAP and the local interpretable model-agnostic explanation algorithms (LIME). The overall incidence of PTB was 11.23% (11 and 12.1% in parous and nulliparous women, respectively). The main risk factors associated with PTB in parous women are previous PTB, previous cesarean section, preeclampsia during pregnancy, and maternal age. In nulliparous women, body mass index at delivery, maternal age, and the presence of amniotic infection were the most relevant risk factors. The trained ML prediction model developed in this study holds promise as a valuable screening tool for predicting PTB within this specific population. Furthermore, SHAP and LIME analyses can assist clinicians in understanding the individualized impact of each risk factor on their patients and provide appropriate care to reduce morbidity and mortality related to PTB.",

            "chunk": "Changes in soil temperature (ST) play an important role in the main mechanisms within the soil, including biological and chemical activities. For instance, they affect the microbial community composition, the speed at which soil organic matter breaks down and becomes minerals. Moreover, the growth and physiological activity of plants are directly influenced by the ST. Additionally, ST indirectly affects plant growth by influencing the accessibility of nutrients in the soil. Therefore, designing an efficient tool for ST estimating at different depths is useful for soil studies by considering meteorological parameters as input parameters, maximal air temperature, minimal air temperature, maximal air relative humidity, minimal air relative humidity, precipitation, and wind speed. This investigation employed various statistical metrics to evaluate the efficacy of the implemented models. These metrics encompassed the correlation coefficient (r), root mean square error (RMSE), Nash-Sutcliffe (NS) efficiency, and mean absolute error (MAE). Hence, this study presented several artificial intelligence-based models, MLPANN, SVR, RFR, and GPR for building robust predictive tools for daily scale ST estimation at 05, 10, 20, 30, 50, and 100cm soil depths. The suggested models are evaluated at two meteorological stations (i.e., Sulaimani and Dukan) located in Kurdistan region, Iraq. Based on assessment of outcomes of this study, the suggested models exhibited exceptional predictive capabilities and comparison of the results showed that among the proposed frameworks, GPR yielded the best results for 05, 10, 20, and 100cm soil depths, with RMSE values of 1.814 degrees C, 1.652 degrees C, 1.773 degrees C, and 2.891 degrees C, respectively. Also, for 50cm soil depth, MLPANN performed the best with an RMSE of 2.289 degrees C at Sulaimani station using the RMSE during the validation phase. Furthermore, GPR produced the most superior outcomes for 10cm, 30cm, and 50cm soil depths, with RMSE values of 1.753 degrees C, 2.270 degrees C, and 2.631 degrees C, respectively. In addition, for 05cm soil depth, SVR achieved the highest level of performance with an RMSE of 1.950 degrees C at Dukan station. The results obtained in this research confirmed that the suggested models have the potential to be effectively used as daily predictive tools at different stations and various depths.",

            "chunk": "Over the past few decades, skin cancer has emerged as a major global health concern. The efficacy of skin cancer treatment greatly depends upon early diagnosis and effective treatment. The automated classification of Melanoma and Nonmelanoma is quite challenging task due to presence of high visual similarities across different classes and variabilities within each class. According to the best of our knowledge, this study represents the classification of Melanoma and Nonmelanoma utilising Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) and Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) under the Nonmelanoma class for the first time. Therefore, this research focuses on automated detection of different skin cancer types to provide assistance to the dermatologists in timely diagnosis and treatment of Melanoma and Nonmelanoma patients. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) methods have gained popularity where Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are employed to accurately classify various skin diseases. However, CNN has limitation in its ability to capture global contextual information which may lead to missing important information. In order to address this issue, this research explores the outlook attention mechanism inspired by vision outlooker, which improves important features while suppressing noisy features. The proposed SkinViT architecture integrates an outlooker block, transformer block and MLP head block to efficiently capture both fine level and global features in order to enhance the accuracy of Melanoma and Nonmelanoma classification. The proposed SkinViT method is assessed by different performance metrics such as recall, precision, classification accuracy, and F1 score. We performed extensive experiments on three datasets, Dataset1 which is extracted from ISIC2019, Dataset2 collected from various online dermatological database and Dataset3 combines both datasets. The proposed SkinViT achieved 0.9109 accuracy on Dataset1, 0.8911 accuracy on Dataset3 and 0.8611 accuracy on Dataset2. Moreover, the proposed SkinViT method outperformed other SOTA models and displayed higher accuracy compared to the previous work in the literature. The proposed method demonstrated higher performance efficiency in classification of Melanoma and Nonmelanoma dermoscopic images. This work is expected to inspire further research in implementing a system for detecting skin cancer that can assist dermatologists in timely diagnosing Melanoma and Nonmelanoma patients.",

            "chunk": "In the context of contemporary artificial intelligence, increasing deep learning (DL) based segmentation methods have been recently proposed for brain tumor segmentation (BraTS) via analysis of multi-modal MRI. However, known DL-based works usually directly fuse the information of different modalities at multiple stages without considering the gap between modalities, leaving much room for performance improvement. In this paper, we introduce a novel deep neural network, termed ACFNet, for accurately segmenting brain tumor in multi-modal MRI. Specifically, ACFNet has a parallel structure with three encoder-decoder streams. The upper and lower streams generate coarse predictions from individual modality, while the middle stream integrates the complementary knowledge of different modalities and bridges the gap between them to yield fine prediction. To effectively integrate the complementary information, we propose an adaptive cross-feature fusion (ACF) module at the encoder that first explores the correlation information between the feature representations from upper and lower streams and then refines the fused correlation information. To bridge the gap between the information from multi-modal data, we propose a prediction inconsistency guidance (PIG) module at the decoder that helps the network focus more on error-prone regions through a guidance strategy when incorporating the features from the encoder. The guidance is obtained by calculating the prediction inconsistency between upper and lower streams and highlights the gap between multi-modal data. Extensive experiments on the BraTS 2020 dataset show that ACFNet is competent for the BraTS task with promising results and outperforms six mainstream competing methods.",

            "chunk": "PURPOSE: This study aimed to assess whether an artificial intelligence model based on facial expressions can accurately predict significant postoperative pain. METHODS: A total of 155 facial expressions from patients who underwent gastric cancer surgery were analyzed to extract facial action units (AUs), gaze, landmarks, and positions. These features were used to construct various machine learning (ML) models, designed to predict significant postoperative pain intensity (NRS >/= 7) from less significant pain (NRS < 7). Significant AUs predictive of NRS >/= 7 were determined and compared to AUs known to be associated with pain in awake patients. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROCs) of the ML models was calculated and compared using DeLong's test. RESULTS: AU17 (chin raising) and AU20 (lip stretching) were found to be associated with NRS >/= 7 (both P </= 0.004). AUs known to be associated with pain in awake patients did not show an association with pain in postoperative patients. An ML model based on AU17 and AU20 demonstrated an AUROC of 0.62 for NRS >/= 7, which was inferior to a model based on all AUs (AUROC = 0.81, P = 0.006). Among facial features, head position and facial landmarks proved to be better predictors of NRS >/= 7 (AUROC, 0.85-0.96) than AUs. A merged ML model that utilized gaze and eye landmarks, as well as head position and facial landmarks, exhibited the best performance (AUROC, 0.90) in predicting significant postoperative pain. CONCLUSION: ML models using facial expressions can accurately predict the presence of significant postoperative pain and have the potential to screen patients in need of rescue analgesia.

            "chunk": "OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess undergraduate medical students' knowledge, attitude, and perception regarding artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine. METHODS: A multi-national, multi-center cross-sectional study was conducted from March to April 2022, targeting undergraduate medical students in nine Arab countries. The study utilized a web-based questionnaire, with data collection carried out with the help of national leaders and local collaborators. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify predictors of knowledge, attitude, and perception among the participants. Additionally, cluster analysis was employed to identify shared patterns within their responses. RESULTS: Of the 4492 students surveyed, 92.4% had not received formal AI training. Regarding AI and deep learning (DL), 87.1% exhibited a low level of knowledge. Most students (84.9%) believed AI would revolutionize medicine and radiology, with 48.9% agreeing that it could reduce the need for radiologists. Students with high/moderate AI knowledge and training had higher odds of agreeing to endorse AI replacing radiologists, reducing their numbers, and being less likely to consider radiology as a career compared to those with low knowledge/no AI training. Additionally, the majority agreed that AI would aid in the automated detection and diagnosis of pathologies. CONCLUSIONS: Arab medical students exhibit a notable deficit in their knowledge and training pertaining to AI. Despite this, they hold a positive perception of AI implementation in medicine and radiology, demonstrating a clear understanding of its significance for the healthcare system and medical curriculum. CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: This study highlights the need for widespread education and training in artificial intelligence for Arab medical students, indicating its significance for healthcare systems and medical curricula. KEY POINTS: * Arab medical students demonstrate a significant knowledge and training gap when it comes to using AI in the fields of medicine and radiology. * Arab medical students recognize the importance of integrating AI into the medical curriculum. Students with a deeper understanding of AI were more likely to agree that all medical students should receive AI education. However, those with previous AI training were less supportive of this idea. * Students with moderate/high AI knowledge and training displayed increased odds of agreeing that AI has the potential to replace radiologists, reduce the demand for their services, and were less inclined to pursue a career in radiology, when compared to students with low knowledge/no AI training.",

The first technique, hybridoma technology, was based on fusion of B lymphocytes with myeloma cells, which resulted in generation of single mAbs against a specific Ag. Along with hybridoma technology, several novel and alternative methods have been developed to improve mAb generation, ranging from electrofusion to the discovery of completely novel technologies such as B cell immortalization; phage, yeast, bacterial, ribosome, and mammalian display systems; DNA/RNA encoded Abs; single B cell technology; transgenic animals; and artificial intelligence/machine learning. This commentary outlines the evolution, methodology, advantages, and limitations of various mAb production techniques. Furthermore, with the advent of next-generation Ab technologies such as single-chain variable fragments, nanobodies, bispecific Abs, Fc-engineered Abs, Ab biosimilars, Ab mimetics, and Ab-drug conjugates, the healthcare and pharmaceutical sectors have become resourceful to develop highly specific mAb treatments against various diseases such as cancer and autoimmune and infectious diseases.",

The LUT is a complex system, comprising various synergetic components (i.e., bladder, urethra, neural control), each with its own dynamic functioning and high interindividual variability. This has led to a variety of different types of models for different purposes, each with advantages and disadvantages. METHODS: When addressing the LUT, the modeling approach should be selected and sized according to the specific purpose, the targeted level of detail, and the available computational resources. Four areas were selected as examples to discuss: utility of nomograms in clinical use, value of fluid mechanical modeling, applications of models to simplify urodynamics, and utility of statistical models. RESULTS: A brief literature review is provided along with discussion of the merits of different types of models for different applications. Remaining research questions are provided. CONCLUSIONS: Inadequacies in current (outdated) models of the LUT as well as recent advances in computing power (e.g., quantum computing) and methods (e.g., artificial intelligence/machine learning), would dictate that the answer is an emphatic \"Yes, the time is right for a new initiative in mathematical modeling of the LUT.\"",

            "chunk": "Type C hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a condition characterized by brain dysfunction caused by liver insufficiency and/or portal-systemic blood shunting, which manifests as a broad spectrum of neurological or psychiatric abnormalities, ranging from minimal HE (MHE), detectable only by neuropsychological or neurophysiological assessment, to coma. Though MHE is the subclinical phase of HE, it is highly prevalent in cirrhotic patients and strongly associated with poor quality of life, high risk of overt HE, and mortality. It is, therefore, critical to identify MHE at the earliest and timely intervene, thereby minimizing the subsequent complications and costs. However, proper and sensitive diagnosis of MHE is hampered by its unnoticeable symptoms and the absence of standard diagnostic criteria. A variety of neuropsychological or neurophysiological tests have been performed to diagnose MHE. However, these tests are nonspecific and susceptible to multiple factors (eg, aging, education), thereby limiting their application in clinical practice. Thus, developing an objective, effective, and noninvasive method is imperative to help detect MHE. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a noninvasive technique which can produce many objective biomarkers by different imaging sequences (eg, Magnetic resonance spectroscopy, DWI, rs-MRI, and arterial spin labeling), has recently shown the ability to screen MHE from NHE (non-HE) patients accurately. As advanced MRI techniques continue to emerge, more minor changes in the brain could be captured, providing new means for early diagnosis and quantitative assessment of MHE. In addition, the advancement of artificial intelligence in medical imaging also presents the potential to mine more effective diagnostic biomarkers and further improves the predictive efficiency of MHE. Taken together, advanced MRI techniques may provide a new perspective for us to identify MHE in the future. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3 TECHNICAL EFFICACY: Stage 2.",

            "chunk": "BACKGROUND: As the serrated pathway has gained prominence as an alternative colorectal carcinogenesis pathway, sessile serrated adenomas or polyps (SSA/P) have been highlighted as lesions to rule out during colonoscopy. These lesions are however morphologically difficult to detect on endoscopy and can be mistaken for hyperplastic polyps due to similar endoscopic features. With the underlying nature of rapid progression and malignant transformation, interval cancer is a likely consequence of undetected or overlooked SSA/P. Real-time artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted colonoscopy via the computer-assisted detection system (CADe) is an increasingly useful tool in improving adenoma detection rate by providing a second eye during the procedure. In this article, we describe a guide through a video to illustrate the detection of SSA/P during AI-assisted colonoscopy. METHODS: Consultant-grade endoscopists utilized real-time AI-assisted colonoscopy device, as part of a larger prospective study, to detect suspicious lesions which were later histopathologically confirmed to be SSA/P. RESULTS: All lesions were picked up by the CADe where a real-time green box highlighted suspicious polyps to the clinician. Three SSA/P of varying morphology are described with reference to classical SSA/P features and with comparison to the features of the hyperplastic polyp found in our study. All three SSA/P observed are in keeping with the JNET Classification (Type 1). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, CADe is a most useful aid to clinicians during endoscopy in the detection of SSA/P but must be complemented with factors such as good endoscopy skill and bowel prep for effective detection, and biopsy coupled with subsequent accurate histological diagnosis.",

            "chunk": "INTRODUCTION: Fifty per cent of patients with cancer require radiotherapy during their disease course, however, only 10%-40% of patients in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) have access to it. A shortfall in specialised workforce has been identified as the most significant barrier to expanding radiotherapy capacity. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based software has been developed to automate both the delineation of anatomical target structures and the definition of the position, size and shape of the radiation beams. Proposed advantages include improved treatment accuracy, as well as a reduction in the time (from weeks to minutes) and human resources needed to deliver radiotherapy. METHODS: ARCHERY is a non-randomised prospective study to evaluate the quality and economic impact of AI-based automated radiotherapy treatment planning for cervical, head and neck, and prostate cancers, which are endemic in LMICs, and for which radiotherapy is the primary curative treatment modality. The sample size of 990 patients (330 for each cancer type) has been calculated based on an estimated 95% treatment plan acceptability rate. Time and cost savings will be analysed as secondary outcome measures using the time-driven activity-based costing model. The 48-month study will take place in six public sector cancer hospitals in India (n=2), Jordan (n=1), Malaysia (n=1) and South Africa (n=2) to support implementation of the software in LMICs. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has received ethical approval from University College London (UCL) and each of the six study sites. If the study objectives are met, the AI-based software will be offered as a not-for-profit web service to public sector state hospitals in LMICs to support expansion of high quality radiotherapy capacity, improving access to and affordability of this key modality of cancer cure and control. Public and policy engagement plans will involve patients as key partners.",

The severity and the rapid progression of TBM underscore the necessity of early and accurate diagnosis to prevent irreversible neurological deficits and reduce mortality rates. Traditional diagnostic methods, reliant primarily on clinical findings and cerebrospinal fluid analysis, often falter in delivering timely and conclusive results. Moreover, such methods struggle to distinguish TBM from other forms of neuroinfections, making it critical to seek advanced diagnostic solutions. Against this backdrop, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has emerged as an indispensable modality in diagnostics, owing to its unique advantages. This review provides an overview of the advancements in MRI technology, specifically emphasizing its crucial applications in the early detection and identification of complex pathological changes in TBM. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) has further enhanced the transformative impact of MRI on TBM diagnostic imaging. When these cutting-edge technologies synergize with deep learning algorithms, they substantially improve diagnostic precision and efficiency. Currently, the field of TBM imaging diagnosis is undergoing a phase of technological amalgamation.

However, AI holds multiple prominent drawbacks, which restrict its wide application today. It is necessary for dentists to be aware of AI's pros and cons before its implementation. PURPOSE: Therefore, the present study was conducted to comprehensively review various applications of AI in all dental branches along with its advantages and disadvantages. MATERIALS AND METHOD: For this review article, a complete query was carried out on PubMed and Google Scholar databases and the studies published during 2010-2022 were collected using the keywords \"Artificial Intelligence\", \"Dentistry,\" \"Machine learning,\" \"Deep learning,\" and \"Diagnostic System.\" Ultimately, 116 relevant articles focused on artificial intelligence in dentistry were selected and evaluated. RESULTS: In new research AI applications in detecting dental abnormalities and oral malignancies based on radiographic view and histopathological features, designing dental implants and crowns, determining tooth preparation finishing line, analyzing growth patterns, estimating biological age, predicting the viability of dental pulp stem cells, analyzing the gene expression of periapical lesions, forensic dentistry, and predicting the success rate of treatments, have been mentioned. Despite AI's benefits in clinical dentistry, three controversial challenges including ease of use, financial return on investment, and evidence of performance exist and need to be managed. CONCLUSION: As evidenced by the obtained results, the most crucial progression of AI is in oral malignancies' diagnostic systems. However, AI's newest advancements in various branches of dentistry require further scientific work before being applied to clinical practice. Moreover, the immense use of AI in clinical dentistry is only achievable when its challenges are appropriately managed.",

METHODS: This longitudinal study was conducted in the adult US general population in two occasions. The initial interviews included 15 states (Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Idaho, Missouri, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming). The follow-up interviews, was done three years later in eight of these states. Of the 19,136 contacted individuals, 15,929 completed the initial interview and 10,931 completed the follow-up. Participants were interviewed using the Sleep-EVAL system, an artificial intelligence tool. Narcolepsy Type 1 (with cataplexy) and Narcolepsy Type 2 (without cataplexy) were defined according to the ICSD-3 classification. Symptoms of narcolepsy were assessed by frequency per week and duration. Medical visits and diagnoses were also collected. RESULTS: Participants were aged between 18 and 102 years of age (mean 45.8 +/- 17.9 years), 51.3 % were women. The prevalence of narcolepsy with cataplexy was 12.6 per 100,000 individuals (95 % C.I., 0 to 30) and narcolepsy without cataplexy was 25.1 per 100,000. The incidence per year was 2.6 per 100,000 individuals (95 % C.I., 0 to 11). CONCLUSIONS: Narcolepsy is a rare condition affecting 37.7/100,000 individuals (126,191 individuals in the current US population). Our US general population prevalence is in line with rates found in community-based studies but lower than what is reported in claim database studies.",

However, its barriers and facilitators in healthcare are not completely understood due to its novel nature. STUDY PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to explore the intricate landscape of AI use in family medicine, aiming to uncover the factors that either hinder or enable its successful adoption. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey design is adopted in this study. The questionnaire included 10 factors (performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, behavioral intention, trust, perceived privacy risk, personal innovativeness, ethical concerns, and facilitators) affecting the acceptance of AI. A total of 157 family physicians participated in the online survey. RESULTS: Effort expectancy (mu = 3.85) and facilitating conditions (mu = 3.77) were identified to be strong influence factors. Access to data (mu = 4.33), increased computing power (mu = 3.92), and telemedicine (mu = 3.78) were identified as major facilitators; regulatory support (mu = 2.29) and interoperability standards (mu = 2.71) were identified as barriers along with privacy and ethical concerns. Younger individuals tend to have more positive attitudes and expectations toward AI-enabled assistants compared to older participants (p < .05). Perceived privacy risk is negatively correlated with all factors. CONCLUSION: Although there are various barriers and concerns regarding the use of AI in healthcare, the preference for AI use in healthcare, especially family medicine, is increasing.",

The treatment landscape for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is rapidly evolving due to the progress made in biomarker-driven targeted therapies. While advancements in targeted treatments have improved survival rates for NSCLC patients with actionable biomarkers, long-term survival remains low, with an overall 5-year relative survival rate below 20%. Artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) algorithms have shown promise in biomarker discovery, yet NSCLC-specific studies capturing the clinical challenges targeted and emerging patterns identified using AI/ML approaches are lacking. Here, we employed a text-mining approach and identified 215 studies that reported potential biomarkers of NSCLC using AI/ML algorithms. We catalogued these studies with respect to BEST (Biomarkers, EndpointS, and other Tools) biomarker sub-types and summarized emerging patterns and trends in AI/ML-driven NSCLC biomarker discovery. We anticipate that our comprehensive review will contribute to the current understanding of AI/ML advances in NSCLC biomarker research and provide an important catalogue that may facilitate clinical adoption of AI/ML-derived biomarkers.",

A recent study by Tomasev and colleagues at DeepMind described a model that achieved a state-of-the-art performance in predicting AKI up to 48 hours in advance.(1) Because this model was trained in a population of US Veterans that was 94% male, questions have arisen about its reproducibility and generalizability. In this study, we aimed to reproduce key aspects of this model, trained and evaluated it in a similar population of US Veterans, and evaluated its generalizability in a large academic hospital setting. We found that the model performed worse in predicting AKI in females in both populations, with miscalibration in lower stages of AKI and worse discrimination (a lower area under the curve) in higher stages of AKI. We demonstrate that while this discrepancy in performance can be largely corrected in non-Veterans by updating the original model using data from a sex-balanced academic hospital cohort, the worse model performance persists in Veterans. Our study sheds light on the importance of reproducing artificial intelligence studies, and on the complexity of discrepancies in model performance in subgroups that cannot be explained simply on the basis of sample size.",

The World Health Organization declared the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern due to the rapid spread of the Mpox virus. Consequently, nations intensified their efforts to explore treatment strategies aimed at combating the infection and its dissemination. Nevertheless, the available therapeutic options for Mpox virus infection remain limited. So far, only a few numbers of antiviral compounds have been approved by regulatory authorities. Given the high mutability of the Mpox virus, certain mutant strains have shown resistance to existing pharmaceutical interventions. This highlights the urgent need to develop novel antiviral drugs that can combat both drug resistance and the potential threat of bioterrorism. Currently, there is a lack of comprehensive literature on the pathophysiology and treatment of Mpox. To address this issue, we conducted a review covering the physiological and pathological processes of Mpox infection, summarizing the latest progress of anti-Mpox drugs. Our analysis encompasses approved drugs currently employed in clinical settings, as well as newly identified small-molecule compounds and antibody drugs displaying potential antiviral efficacy against Mpox. Furthermore, we have gained valuable insights from the process of Mpox drug development, including strategies for repurposing drugs, the discovery of drug targets driven by artificial intelligence, and preclinical drug development.

METHOD: A bibliographic search using a combination of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) descriptors and free-text terms on CRI was performed using PubMed, followed by a double-blind review in order to select a list of candidate best papers to be then peer-reviewed by external reviewers. After peer-review ranking, a consensus meeting between the two section editors and the editorial team was organized to finally conclude on the selected three best papers. RESULTS: Among the 1,324 papers returned by the search, published in 2022, that were in the scope of the various areas of CRI, the full review process selected four best papers. The first best paper describes the process undertaken in Germany, under the national Medical Informatics Initiative, to define a process and to gain multi-decision-maker acceptance of broad consent for the reuse of health data for research whilst remaining compliant with the European General Data Protection Regulation. The authors of the second-best paper present a federated architecture for the conduct of clinical trial feasibility queries that utilizes HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources and an HL7 standard query representation. The third best paper aligns with the overall theme of this Yearbook, the inclusivity of potential participants in clinical trials, with recommendations to ensure greater equity. The fourth proposes a multi-modal modelling approach for large scale phenotyping from electronic health record information. This year's survey paper has also examined equity, along with data bias, and found that the relevant publications in 2022 have focused almost exclusively on the issue of bias in Artificial Intelligence (AI). CONCLUSIONS: The literature relevant to CRI in 2022 has largely been dominated by publications that seek to maximise the reusability of wide scale and representative electronic health record information for research, either as big data for distributed analysis or as a source of information from which to identify suitable patients accurately and equitably for invitation to participate in clinical trials.",

METHOD: PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, EMBASE, the tables of contents of major informatics journals, and the bibliographies of articles were searched for studies reporting evaluation of AI in clinical settings from January 2021 to December 2022. We documented the clinical application areas and tasks supported, and the level of system autonomy. Reported effects on user experience, decision-making, care delivery and outcomes were summarised. RESULTS: AI technologies are being applied in a wide variety of clinical areas. Most contemporary systems utilise deep learning, use routinely collected data, support diagnosis and triage, are assistive (requiring users to confirm or approve AI provided information or decisions), and are used by doctors in acute care settings in high-income nations. AI systems are integrated and used within existing clinical information systems including electronic medical records. There is limited support for One Health goals. Evaluation is largely based on quantitative methods measuring effects on decision-making. CONCLUSION: AI systems are being implemented and evaluated in many clinical areas. There remain many opportunities to understand patterns of routine use and evaluate effects on decision-making, care delivery and patient outcomes using mixed-methods. Support for One Health including integrating data about environmental factors and social determinants needs further exploration.",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate if the artificial intelligence (AI) programs Chat-GPT and Perplexity.AI can perform an orthopedic surgery literature review. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five different search topics of varying specificity within orthopedic surgery were chosen for each search arm to investigate. A consolidated list of unique articles for each search topic was recorded for the experimental AI search arms and compared with the results of the control arm of two independent reviewers. Articles in the experimental arms were examined by the two independent reviewers for relevancy and validity. RESULTS: ChatGPT was able to identify a total of 61 unique articles. Four articles were not relevant to the search topic and 51 articles were deemed to be fraudulent, resulting in 6 valid articles. Perplexity.AI was able to identify a total of 43 unique articles. Nineteen were not relevant to the search topic but all articles were able to be verified, resulting in 24 valid articles. The control arm was able to identify 132 articles. Success rates for ChatGPT and Perplexity.AI were 4.6% (6 of 132) and 18.2% (24 of 132), respectively. CONCLUSION: The current iteration of ChatGPT cannot perform a reliable literature review, and Perplexity.AI is only able to perform a limited review of the medical literature. Any utilization of these open AI programs should be done with caution and human quality assurance to promote responsible use and avoid the risk of using fabricated search results.

            "chunk": "IMPORTANCE: Cognitive dysfunction is common after traumatic brain injury (TBI), with a well-established dose-response relationship between TBI severity and likelihood or magnitude of persistent cognitive impairment. However, patterns of cognitive dysfunction in the long-term (eg, 6-month) recovery period are less well known. OBJECTIVE: To characterize the prevalence of cognitive dysfunction within and across cognitive domains (processing speed, memory, and executive functioning) 6 months after injury in patients with TBI seen at level I trauma centers. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prospective longitudinal cohort study used data from Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in TBI (TRACK-TBI) and included patients aged 17 years or older presenting at 18 US level I trauma center emergency departments or inpatient units within 24 hours of head injury, control individuals with orthopedic injury recruited from the same centers, and uninjured friend and family controls. Participants were enrolled between March 2, 2014, and July 27, 2018. Data were analyzed from March 5, 2020, through October 3, 2023. EXPOSURES: Traumatic brain injury (Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3-15) or orthopedic injury. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Performance on standard neuropsychological tests, including premorbid cognitive ability (National Institutes of Health Toolbox Picture Vocabulary Test), verbal memory (Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test), processing speed (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale [4th edition] Processing Speed Index), and executive functioning (Trail Making Test). RESULTS: The sample included 1057 persons with TBI (mean [SD] age, 39.3 [16.4] years; 705 [67%] male) and 327 controls without TBI (mean [SD] age, 38.4 [15.1] years; 222 [68%] male). Most persons with TBI demonstrated performance within 1.5 SDs or better of the control group (49.3% [95% CI, 39.5%-59.2%] to 67.5% [95% CI, 63.7%-71.2%] showed no evidence of impairment). Similarly, 64.4% (95% CI, 54.5%-73.4%) to 78.8% (95% CI, 75.4%-81.9%) of participants demonstrated no evidence of cognitive decline (defined as performance within 1.5 SDs of estimated premorbid ability). For individuals with evidence of either cognitive impairment or decline, diverse profiles of impairment across memory, speed, and executive functioning domains were observed (ie, the prevalence was >0 in each of the 7 combinations of impairment across these 3 cognitive domains for most TBI subgroups). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study of patients seen at level I trauma centers 6 months after TBI, many patients with TBI demonstrated no cognitive impairment. Impairment was more prevalent in persons with more severe TBI and manifested in variable ways across individuals. The findings may guide future research and treatment recommendations.",

Computer-aided detection (CADe) has improved adenoma detection rate (ADR) and adenomas per colonoscopy (APC) in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). There is a need to assess the impact of CADe in real-world settings. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science for non-randomized, real-world studies of CADe in colonoscopy. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed to examine the effect of CADe on ADR and APC. The study is registered under PROSPERO (CRD42023424037). There was no funding for this study. RESULTS: Twelve of 1,314 studies met inclusion criteria. Overall, ADR was statistically significantly higher with vs. without CADe (36.3% vs. 35.8%, risk ratio [RR] 1.13, 95% CI 1.01-1.28). This difference remained significant in subgroup analyses evaluating 6 prospective (37.3% vs 35.2%, RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.01-1.32) but not 6 retrospective (35.7% vs 36.2%, RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.92-1.36) studies. Among 6 studies with APC data, APC rate ratio with vs. without CADe was 1.12 (95% CI 0.95-1.33). In 4 studies with GI Genius (Medtronic), there was no difference in ADR with vs. without CADe (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.85-1.07). CONCLUSIONS: ADR, but not APC, was slightly higher with vs. without CADe among all available real-world studies. This difference was attributed to the results of prospective but not retrospective studies. The discrepancies between these findings vs. those of RCTs call for future research on the true impact of current AI technology on colonoscopy quality, and the subtleties of human-AI interactions.",

Large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer), present a promising yet underexplored avenue for such innovations. AIMS: This study explores the utility of ChatGPT to generate diverse, high-quality medical questions, focusing on multiple-choice questions (MCQs) as an illustrative example, to increase educator's productivity and enable self-directed learning for students. DESCRIPTION: Leveraging 12 strategies, we demonstrate how ChatGPT can be effectively used to generate assessment questions aligned with Bloom's taxonomy and core knowledge domains while promoting best practices in assessment design. CONCLUSION: Integrating LLM tools like ChatGPT into generating medical assessment questions like MCQs augments but does not replace human expertise. With continual instruction refinement, AI can produce high-standard questions. Yet, the onus of ensuring ultimate quality and accuracy remains with subject matter experts, affirming the irreplaceable value of human involvement in the artificial intelligence-driven education paradigm.",

Early identification of women at high risk of PTB is important, given the availability of evidence-based, effective screening modalities, which facilitate decision-making on preventative strategies, particularly transvaginal sonographic cervical length (CL) measurement. There is growing evidence that combining CL with quantitative fetal fibronectin (qfFN) and maternal risk factors in the extensively peer-reviewed and validated QUanititative Innovation in Predicting Preterm birth (QUiPP) application can aid both the triage of patients who present as emergencies with symptoms of preterm labor and high-risk asymptomatic women attending PTB surveillance clinics. The QUiPP app risk of delivery thus supports shared decision-making with patients on the need for increased outpatient surveillance, in-patient treatment for preterm labor or simply reassurance for those unlikely to deliver preterm. Effective triage of patients at preterm gestations is an obstetric clinical priority as correctly timed administration of antenatal corticosteroids will maximise their neonatal benefits. This review explores the predictive capacity of existing predictive tests for PTB in both singleton and multiple pregnancies, including the QUiPP app v.2. and discusses promising new research areas, which aim to predict PTB through cervical stiffness and elastography measurements, metabolomics, extracellular vesicles and artificial intelligence.",

The management of water resources can be facilitated by artificial intelligence (AI) with the help of data analytics, regression models, and algorithms. Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development of the United Nations depends on understanding, communicating, and measuring the value of water and incorporating it into decision-making. Various barriers are used from the source to the consumer to prevent microbiological contamination of drinking water sources or reduce contamination to levels safe for human health. Infrastructure development and capacity-building policies should be integrated with guidelines on applying AI to problems relating to water to ensure good development outcomes. Communities can live healthily with such technology if they can provide clean, economical, and sustainable water to the ecosystem as a whole. Quick and accurate identification of waterborne pathogens in drinking and recreational water sources is essential for treating and controlling the spread of water-related diseases, especially in resource-constrained situations. To ensure successful development outcomes, policies on infrastructure development and capacity building should be combined with those on applying AI to water-related problems. The primary focus of this study is the use of AI in managing drinking water and preventing waterborne illness.",

The use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning methods in wound analysis is promising. Explainable modelling can help its integration and acceptance in healthcare systems. We aim to develop an explainable AI model for analysing vascular wound images among an Asian population. Two thousand nine hundred and fifty-seven wound images from a vascular wound image registry from a tertiary institution in Singapore were utilized. The dataset was split into training, validation and test sets. Wound images were classified into four types (neuroischaemic ulcer [NIU], surgical site infections [SSI], venous leg ulcers [VLU], pressure ulcer [PU]), measured with automatic estimation of width, length and depth and segmented into 18 wound and peri-wound features. Data pre-processing was performed using oversampling and augmentation techniques. Convolutional and deep learning models were utilized for model development. The model was evaluated with accuracy, F1 score and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Explainability methods were used to interpret AI decision reasoning. A web browser application was developed to demonstrate results of the wound AI model with explainability. After development, the model was tested on additional 15 476 unlabelled images to evaluate effectiveness. After the development on the training and validation dataset, the model performance on unseen labelled images in the test set achieved an AUROC of 0.99 for wound classification with mean accuracy of 95.9%. For wound measurements, the model achieved AUROC of 0.97 with mean accuracy of 85.0% for depth classification, and AUROC of 0.92 with mean accuracy of 87.1% for width and length determination. For wound segmentation, an AUROC of 0.95 and mean accuracy of 87.8% was achieved. Testing on unlabelled images, the model confidence score for wound classification was 82.8% with an explainability score of 60.6%. Confidence score was 87.6% for depth classification with 68.0% explainability score, while width and length measurement obtained 93.0% accuracy score with 76.6% explainability. Confidence score for wound segmentation was 83.9%, while explainability was 72.1%. Using explainable AI models, we have developed an algorithm and application for analysis of vascular wound images from an Asian population with accuracy and explainability. With further development, it can be utilized as a clinical decision support system and integrated into existing healthcare electronic systems.",

Preschool wheezing exhibits both \"curricular\" and \"aetiological\" heterogeneity: that is, heterogeneity across patients both in the time-course of its development and in its underpinning pathological mechanisms. Since these are not fully understood, but clinical presentations across patients may nonetheless be similar, current diagnostic labels are imprecise-not mapping cleanly onto underlying disease mechanisms-and prognoses uncertain. These uncertainties also make a identifying new targets for therapeutic intervention difficult. In the past few decades, carefully designed birth cohort studies have collected \"big data\" on a large scale, incorporating not only a wealth of longitudinal clinical data, but also detailed information from modalities as varied as imaging, multiomics, and blood biomarkers. The profusion of big data has seen the proliferation of what we term \"modern data approaches\" (MDAs)-grouping together machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data science-to make sense and make use of this data. In this review, we survey applications of MDAs (with an emphasis on machine learning) in childhood wheeze and asthma, highlighting the extent of their successes in providing tools for prognosis, unpicking the curricular heterogeneity of these conditions, clarifying the limitations of current diagnostic criteria, and indicating directions of research for uncovering the etiology of the diseases underlying these conditions. Specifically, we focus on the trajectories of childhood wheeze phenotypes. Further, we provide an explainer of the nature and potential use of MDAs and emphasize the scope of what we can hope to achieve with them.",

            "chunk": "With the rapid development of modern industry and the increasing prominence of artificial intelligence, data-driven process monitoring methods have gained significant popularity in industrial systems. Traditional static monitoring models struggle to represent the new modes that arise in industrial production processes due to changes in production environments and operating conditions. Retraining these models to address the changes often leads to high computational complexity. To address this issue, we propose a multimode process monitoring method based on element-aware lifelong dictionary learning (EaLDL). This method initially treats dictionary elements as fundamental units and measures the global importance of dictionary elements from the perspective of the multimode global learning process. Subsequently, to ensure that the dictionary can represent new modes without losing the representation capability of historical modes during the updating process, we construct a novel surrogate loss to impose constraints on the update of dictionary elements. This constraint enables the continuous updating of the dictionary learning (DL) method to accommodate new modes without compromising the representation of previous modes. Finally, to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we perform comprehensive experiments on numerical simulations as well as an industrial process. A comparison is made with several advanced process monitoring methods to assess its performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves a favorable balance between learning new modes and retaining the memory of historical modes. Moreover, the proposed method exhibits insensitivity to initial points, delivering satisfactory results under various initial conditions.",

            "chunk": "BACKGROUND: ChatGPT may act as a research assistant to help organize the direction of thinking and summarize research findings. However, few studies have examined the quality, similarity (abstracts being similar to the original one), and accuracy of the abstracts generated by ChatGPT when researchers provide full-text basic research papers. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the applicability of an artificial intelligence (AI) model in generating abstracts for basic preclinical research. METHODS: We selected 30 basic research papers from Nature, Genome Biology, and Biological Psychiatry. Excluding abstracts, we inputted the full text into ChatPDF, an application of a language model based on ChatGPT, and we prompted it to generate abstracts with the same style as used in the original papers. A total of 8 experts were invited to evaluate the quality of these abstracts (based on a Likert scale of 0-10) and identify which abstracts were generated by ChatPDF, using a blind approach. These abstracts were also evaluated for their similarity to the original abstracts and the accuracy of the AI content. RESULTS: The quality of ChatGPT-generated abstracts was lower than that of the actual abstracts (10-point Likert scale: mean 4.72, SD 2.09 vs mean 8.09, SD 1.03; P<.001). The difference in quality was significant in the unstructured format (mean difference -4.33; 95% CI -4.79 to -3.86; P<.001) but minimal in the 4-subheading structured format (mean difference -2.33; 95% CI -2.79 to -1.86). Among the 30 ChatGPT-generated abstracts, 3 showed wrong conclusions, and 10 were identified as AI content. The mean percentage of similarity between the original and the generated abstracts was not high (2.10%-4.40%). The blinded reviewers achieved a 93% (224/240) accuracy rate in guessing which abstracts were written using ChatGPT. CONCLUSIONS: Using ChatGPT to generate a scientific abstract may not lead to issues of similarity when using real full texts written by humans. However, the quality of the ChatGPT-generated abstracts was suboptimal, and their accuracy was not 100%.",

Although pharmacists use methods like barcode scanning and double-checking for dispensing verification, these measures exhibit limitations. The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in pharmacy verification emerges as a potential solution, offering precision, rapid data analysis, and the ability to recognize medications through computer vision. For AI to be embraced, it must be designed with the end user in mind, fostering trust, clear communication, and seamless collaboration between AI and pharmacists. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to gather pharmacists' feedback in a focus group setting to help inform the initial design of the user interface and iterative designs of the AI prototype. METHODS: A multidisciplinary research team engaged pharmacists in a 3-stage process to develop a human-centered AI system for medication dispensing verification. To design the AI model, we used a Bayesian neural network that predicts the dispensed pills' National Drug Code (NDC). Discussion scripts regarding how to design the system and feedback in focus groups were collected through audio recordings and professionally transcribed, followed by a content analysis guided by the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety and Human-Machine Teaming theoretical frameworks. RESULTS: A total of 8 pharmacists participated in 3 rounds of focus groups to identify current challenges in medication dispensing verification, brainstorm solutions, and provide feedback on our AI prototype. Participants considered several teaming scenarios, generally favoring a hybrid teaming model where the AI assists in the verification process and a pharmacist intervenes based on medication risk level and the AI's confidence level. Pharmacists highlighted the need for improving the interpretability of AI systems, such as adding stepwise checkmarks, probability scores, and details about drugs the AI model frequently confuses with the target drug. Pharmacists emphasized the need for simplicity and accessibility. They favored displaying only essential information to prevent overwhelming users with excessive data. Specific design features, such as juxtaposing pill images with their packaging for quick comparisons, were requested. Pharmacists preferred accept, reject, or unsure options. The final prototype interface included (1) checkmarks to compare pill characteristics between the AI-predicted NDC and the prescription's expected NDC, (2) a histogram showing predicted probabilities for the AI-identified NDC, (3) an image of an AI-provided \"confused\" pill, and (4) an NDC match status (ie, match, unmatched, or unsure). CONCLUSIONS: In partnership with pharmacists, we developed a human-centered AI prototype designed to enhance AI interpretability and foster trust. This initiative emphasized human-machine collaboration and positioned AI as an augmentative tool rather than a replacement. This study highlights the process of designing a human-centered AI for dispensing verification, emphasizing its interpretability, confidence visualization, and collaborative human-machine teaming styles.",

As AI continues to transform various aspects of our lives, one critical question arises for medical education: what will be the nature of education, teaching, and learning in a future world where the acquisition, retention, and application of knowledge in the traditional sense are fundamentally altered by AI? OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this perspective is to plan for the intersection of health care and medical education in the future. METHODS: We used GPT-4 and scenario-based strategic planning techniques to craft 4 hypothetical future worlds influenced by AI's integration into health care and medical education. This method, used by organizations such as Shell and the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, assesses readiness for alternative futures and effectively manages uncertainty, risk, and opportunity. The detailed scenarios provide insights into potential environments the medical profession may face and lay the foundation for hypothesis generation and idea-building regarding responsible AI implementation. RESULTS: The following 4 worlds were created using OpenAI's GPT model: AI Harmony, AI conflict, The world of Ecological Balance, and Existential Risk. Risks include disinformation and misinformation, loss of privacy, widening inequity, erosion of human autonomy, and ethical dilemmas. Benefits involve improved efficiency, personalized interventions, enhanced collaboration, early detection, and accelerated research. CONCLUSIONS: To ensure responsible AI use, the authors suggest focusing on 3 key areas: developing a robust ethical framework, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration, and investing in education and training. A strong ethical framework emphasizes patient safety, privacy, and autonomy while promoting equity and inclusivity. Interdisciplinary collaboration encourages cooperation among various experts in developing and implementing AI technologies, ensuring that they address the complex needs and challenges in health care and medical education. Investing in education and training prepares professionals and trainees with necessary skills and knowledge to effectively use and critically evaluate AI technologies.

Traditional electronic learning (e-learning) platforms have long served as a cornerstone in radiology education, offering rich visual content, interactive sessions, and peer-reviewed materials. They excel in teaching intricate concepts and techniques that necessitate visual aids, such as image interpretation and procedural demonstrations. However, Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT), an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered language model, has made its mark in radiology education. It can generate learning assessments, create lesson plans, act as a round-the-clock virtual tutor, enhance critical thinking, translate materials for broader accessibility, summarize vast amounts of information, and provide real-time feedback for any subject, including radiology. Concerns have arisen regarding ChatGPT's data accuracy, currency, and potential biases, especially in specialized fields such as radiology. However, the quality, accessibility, and currency of e-learning content can also be imperfect. To enhance the educational journey for radiology residents, the integration of ChatGPT with expert-curated e-learning resources is imperative for ensuring accuracy and reliability and addressing ethical concerns. While AI is unlikely to entirely supplant traditional radiology study methods, the synergistic combination of AI with traditional e-learning can create a holistic educational experience.",

            "chunk": "INTRODUCTION: Artificial intelligence (AI) technology has made rapid progress for disease diagnosis and triage. In the field of ophthalmic diseases, image-based diagnosis has achieved high accuracy but still encounters limitations due to the lack of medical history. The emergence of ChatGPT enables human-computer interaction, allowing for the development of a multimodal AI system that integrates interactive text and image information. OBJECTIVE: To develop a multimodal AI system using ChatGPT and anterior segment images for diagnosing and triaging ophthalmic diseases. To assess the AI system's performance through a two-stage cross-sectional study, starting with silent evaluation and followed by early clinical evaluation in outpatient clinics. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Our study will be conducted across three distinct centers in Shanghai, Nanjing, and Suqian. The development of the smartphone-based multimodal AI system will take place in Shanghai with the goal of achieving >/=90% sensitivity and >/=95% specificity for diagnosing and triaging ophthalmic diseases. The first stage of the cross-sectional study will explore the system's performance in Shanghai's outpatient clinics. Medical histories will be collected without patient interaction, and anterior segment images will be captured using slit lamp equipment. This stage aims for >/=85% sensitivity and >/=95% specificity with a sample size of 100 patients. The second stage will take place at three locations, with Shanghai serving as the internal validation dataset, and Nanjing and Suqian as the external validation dataset. Medical history will be collected through patient interviews, and anterior segment images will be captured via smartphone devices. An expert panel will establish reference standards and assess AI accuracy for diagnosis and triage throughout all stages. A one-vs.-rest strategy will be used for data analysis, and a post-hoc power calculation will be performed to evaluate the impact of disease types on AI performance. DISCUSSION: Our study may provide a user-friendly smartphone-based multimodal AI system for diagnosis and triage of ophthalmic diseases. This innovative system may support early detection of ocular abnormalities, facilitate establishment of a tiered healthcare system, and reduce the burdens on tertiary facilities. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov on June 25th, 2023 (NCT05930444).",

In this research endeavor, we harnessed the capabilities of AI to enhance the precision of hysteroscopic myomectomy procedures. METHODS: Our multidisciplinary team developed a comprehensive suite of algorithms, rooted in deep learning technology, addressing myomas segmentation tasks. We assembled a cohort comprising 56 patients diagnosed with submucosal myomas, each of whom underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations. Subsequently, half of the participants were randomly designated to undergo AI-augmented procedures. Our AI system exhibited remarkable proficiency in elucidating the precise spatial localization of submucosal myomas. RESULTS: The results of our study showcased a statistically significant reduction in both operative duration (41.32 +/- 17.83 minutes vs. 32.11 +/- 11.86 minutes, p=0.03) and intraoperative blood loss (10.00 (6.25-15.00) ml vs. 10.00 (5.00-15.00) ml, p=0.04) in procedures assisted by AI.

            "chunk": "Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) in general and Natural Language Processing (NLP) in particular are paving the new way forward for the automated detection and prediction of mental health disorders among the population. Recent research in this area has prioritized predictive accuracy over model interpretability by relying on deep learning methods. However, prioritizing predictive accuracy over model interpretability can result in a lack of transparency in the decision-making process, which is critical in sensitive applications such as healthcare. There is thus a growing need for explainable AI (XAI) approaches to psychiatric diagnosis and prediction. The main aim of this work is to address a gap by conducting a systematic investigation of XAI approaches in the realm of automatic detection of mental disorders from language behavior leveraging textual data from social media. In pursuit of this aim, we perform extensive experiments to evaluate the balance between accuracy and interpretability across predictive mental health models. More specifically, we build BiLSTM models trained on a comprehensive set of human-interpretable features, encompassing syntactic complexity, lexical sophistication, readability, cohesion, stylistics, as well as topics and sentiment/emotions derived from lexicon-based dictionaries to capture multiple dimensions of language production. We conduct extensive feature ablation experiments to determine the most informative feature groups associated with specific mental health conditions. We juxtapose the performance of these models against a \"black-box\" domain-specific pretrained transformer adapted for mental health applications. To enhance the interpretability of the transformers models, we utilize a multi-task fusion learning framework infusing information from two relevant domains (emotion and personality traits). Moreover, we employ two distinct explanation techniques: the local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) method and a model-specific self-explaining method (AGRAD). These methods allow us to discern the specific categories of words that the information-infused models rely on when generating predictions. Our proposed approaches are evaluated on two public English benchmark datasets, subsuming five mental health conditions (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, bipolar disorder, depression and psychological stress).",

Our study aimed to assess the persistent effects of COVID-19 on physical and mental health, fatigue, and cognitive performance in a cohort of 214 students, averaging 21.8 years of age. Of these, 148 had contracted COVID-19 but were not hospitalized, with the time since infection ranging from 1 to 39 months. We utilized a comprehensive panel of cognitive tests to measure intelligence, memory, and psychomotor skills, and a detailed anamnestic questionnaire to evaluate physical and mental health. While contracting COVID-19 did not significantly impact overall health and performance, it was associated with increased reports of fatigue. However, the reported severity of the disease had a pronounced negative influence on physical health, mental well-being, fatigue, and reaction time. Trends of improvement in physical and mental health, as well as error rate, were observed within the first 2 years post-infection. However, fatigue and reaction time showed a trend of deterioration. Beyond the 2-year mark, physical health and error rate continued to improve, while mental health began to deteriorate. Fatigue and reaction time continued to decline. Overall, our findings suggest that some effects of contracting COVID-19 can persist or even deteriorate over time, even in younger individuals who had mild cases that did not require hospitalization.",

Nevertheless, interobserver variability can significantly impact overall assessment performance. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to develop a deep learning algorithm for the real-time and objective evaluation of endoscopic disease activity and prediction of histological remission in UC. DESIGN: This is a retrospective diagnostic study. METHODS: Two convolutional neural network (CNN) models were constructed and trained using 12,257 endoscopic images and biopsy results sourced from 1124 UC patients who underwent colonoscopy at a single center from January 2018 to December 2022. Mayo Endoscopy Subscore (MES) and UC Endoscopic Index of Severity Score (UCEIS) assessments were conducted by two experienced and independent reviewers. Model performance was evaluated in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and positive predictive value. The output of the CNN models was also compared with the corresponding histological results to assess histological remission prediction performance. RESULTS: The MES-CNN model achieved 97.04% accuracy in diagnosing endoscopic remission of UC, while the MES-CNN and UCEIS-CNN models achieved 90.15% and 85.29% accuracy, respectively, in evaluating endoscopic severity of UC. For predicting histological remission, the CNN models achieved accuracy and kappa values of 91.28% and 0.826, respectively, attaining higher accuracy than human endoscopists (87.69%).

Artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted Ultreon 2.0 software could address this barrier. We used eye tracking to understand how these software changes impact viewing efficiency and accuracy. METHODS: Eighteen interventional cardiologists and fellows at McMaster University, Canada, were included in the study and categorized as experienced or inexperienced based on lifetime OCT use. They were tasked with reviewing OCT images from both Ultreon 2.0 and AptiVue software platforms while their eye movements were recorded. Key metrics, such as time to first fixation on the area of interest, total task time, dwell time (time spent on the area of interest as a proportion of total task time), and interpretation accuracy, were evaluated using a mixed multivariate model. RESULTS: Physicians exhibited improved viewing efficiency with Ultreon 2.0, characterized by reduced time to first fixation (Ultreon 0.9 s vs. AptiVue 1.6 s, p = 0.007), reduced total task time (Ultreon 10.2 s vs. AptiVue 12.6 s, p = 0.006), and increased dwell time in the area of interest (Ultreon 58% vs. AptiVue 41%, p < 0.001). These effects were similar for experienced and inexperienced physicians. Accuracy of OCT image interpretation was preserved in both groups, with experienced physicians outperforming inexperienced physicians. DISCUSSION: Our study demonstrated that AI-enabled Ultreon 2.0 software can streamline the image interpretation process and improve viewing efficiency for both inexperienced and experienced physicians. Enhanced viewing efficiency implies reduced cognitive load potentially reducing the barriers for OCT adoption in PCI decision-making.",

In this article, the designing of intelligence computing through a neural network that is backpropagated with the Levenberg-Marquardt method (NN-BLMM) to study the Cattaneo-Christov heat flow model at the mixed impulse stagnation point (CCHFM-MISP) past a Riga plate is investigated. The original model CCHFM-MISP in terms of PDEs is converted into non-linear ODEs through suitable similarity variables. A data set is generated for all scenarios of CCHFM-MISP through Lobatto IIIA numerical solver by varying Hartman number, velocity ratio parameter, inverse Darcy number, mixed impulse variable, non-dimensional constraint, Eckert number, heat generation variable, Prandtl number, thermal relaxation variable. To find the physical impacts of parameters of interest associated with the presented fluidic system CCHFM-MISP, the approximate solution of NN-BLMM is carried out by performing training (80 %), testing (10 %), and validation (10 %), and then the results are equated with the reference data to ensure the perfection of the proposed model. Through MSE, state transition, error histogram, and regression analysis, the outcomes of NN-BLMM are presented and analyzed. The graphical illustration and numerical outcomes confirm the authentication and effectiveness of the solver. Moreover, mean square errors for validation, training and testing data points along with performance measures lie around 10(-10) and the solution plots generated through deterministic (Lobatto IIIA) approach and stochastic numerical solver are matching up to 10(-6), which surely validate the solver NN-BLMM. The outcomes of M and B on velocity present the similar impacts. The velocity of material particles decreases under Da while, it increases through velocity ratio and magnetic parameters.",

This review is focusing on the psychological aspects of Sturge-Weber syndrome patients, the behaviors of patients, and the effects of the disease on the children. This disorder is characterized by angiomas, glaucoma, and seizures with a birthmark. Patients with this syndrome have behavioral problems, a lack of social skills, and a lack of intellectual or academic skills. These patients are usually introverted because of a lack of warmth and limited communication. Friends or classmates tease them by calling them \"ugly.\" All this leads to a lack of social skills, and they mostly keep their feelings to themselves and prefer to be alone. Because of all this mocking by classmates, they keep isolating themselves. All this causes psychological problems in children. They start behaving differently, have suicidal tendencies, and fight with their friends who bully them. Psychological problems are mostly seen in children who are lacking in intelligence and functioning and who have seizure disorders, mostly in those who have frequent seizures. Problems like anxiety, depression, mood changes, anger, and violence are also observed in these patients. All this is always ignored by the parents as well as the doctors. This review aims to focus on the psychological aspect of the patients with SWS, to inform the parents about the behavior of their children with SWS, and to pay more attention to the psychological problems. This review is focusing on the importance of the psychological behavior of patients with SWS, how to diagnose it at an early stage, and how to treat and take care of children with SWS.",

            "chunk": "BACKGROUND: Grey-matter abnormalities in depression are potentially attributable to some combination of trait, state, and illness-history factors. Here, we sought to determine the contributions of polygenic risk for depression, depressive-disease status, and their interaction to these grey-matter abnormalities. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional comparison using a 2x3 factorial design examining effects of Polygenic Risk for depression (lower versus upper quartile) and Depression Status (never depressed, currently depressed, or remitted depressed) on regional grey-matter concentration and grey-matter volume. Participants were a subset of MRI-scanned UK Biobank participants comprising 2682 persons (1806 females, 876 males), algorithmically matched on 16 potential confounders. RESULTS: In females but not males we observed that elevated polygenic risk for depression was associated with reduced cerebellar grey-matter volume. This deficit occurred in salience- and dorsal-attention-network regions of the cerebellum and was associated with poorer performance on tests of attention and executive function but not fluid intelligence. Moreover, in currently depressed women, relative both to remitted depressed and never-disordered women, we observed grey-matter reductions in ventral and medial prefrontal, insular, and medial temporal regions. These state-related abnormalities remained when accounting for anti-depressant medication status. CONCLUSIONS: Neuroanatomical deficits attributed broadly to major depression are more likely due to an aggregation of independent factors. Polygenic risk for depression accounts for cerebellar structural abnormalities which, themselves, account for cognitive deficits observed in this disorder. Medial and ventral prefrontal, insular, and temporal cortex deficits constitute a much larger proportion of the aggregate deficit and are attributable to the depressed state.",

In this Review, we provide an overview of the current state of immune profiling in sepsis, including its use, current challenges, and opportunities for progress. We highlight the important role of immunological biomarkers in facilitating predictive enrichment in current and future treatment scenarios. We propose that multiple immune and non-immune-related parameters, including clinical and microbiological data, be integrated into diagnostic and predictive combitypes, with the aid of machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques. These combitypes could form the basis of workable algorithms to guide clinical decisions that make precision medicine in sepsis a reality and improve patient outcomes.",

METHODS: A total of 1696 2D prostate TRUS images were involved from 142 patients between July 2021 and May 2022. The ResNet50 network model was utilized to train classification models with different input methods: original image (Whole model), BNT (Needle model), and combined image [Feature Pyramid Networks (FPN) model]. The training set, validation set, and test set were randomly assigned, then randomized 5-fold cross-validation between the training set and validation set was performed. The diagnostic effectiveness of AI models and image combination was accessed by an independent testing set. Then, the optimal AI model and image combination were selected to compare the diagnostic efficacy with that of senior radiologists and the clinical model. RESULTS: In the test set, the area under the curve, specificity, and sensitivity of the FPN model were 0.934, 0.966, and 0.829, respectively; the diagnostic efficacy was improved compared with the Whole and Needle models, with statistically significant differences (P < 0.05), and was better than that of senior radiologists (area under the curve: 0.667). The FPN model detected more PCa compared with senior physicians (82.9% vs. 55.8%), with a 61.3% decrease in the false-positive rate and a 23.2% increase in overall accuracy (0.887 vs. 0.655). CONCLUSION: The proposed FPN model can offer a new method for prostate tissue classification, improve the diagnostic performance, and may be a helpful tool to guide prostate biopsy.",

This content can be used for surgical education and qualitative initiatives. We demonstrate the first use of AI in urologic robotic surgery to capture live surgical video and annotate key surgical steps and safety milestones in real-time. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: While AI models possess the capability to generate automated annotations based on a collection of video images, the real-time implementation of such technology in urological robotic surgery to aid surgeon and training staff it is still pending to be studied. METHODS: We conducted an educational symposium, which broadcasted 2 live procedures, a robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) and a robotic-assisted partial nephrectomy (RAPN). A surgical AI platform system (Theator, Palo Alto, CA) generated real-time annotations and identified operative safety milestones. This was achieved through trained algorithms, conventional video recognition, and novel Video Transfer Network technology which captures clips in full context, enabling automatic recognition and surgical mapping in real-time. RESULTS: Real-time AI annotations for procedure #1, RARP, are found in Table 1. The safety milestone annotations included the apical safety maneuver and deliberate views of structures such as the external iliac vessels and the obturator nerve. Real-time AI annotations for procedure #2, RAPN, are found in Table 1. Safety milestones included deliberate views of structures such as the gonadal vessels and the ureter. AI annotated surgical events included intraoperative ultrasound, temporary clip application and removal, hemostatic powder application, and notable hemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, surgical intelligence successfully showcased real-time AI annotations of 2 separate urologic robotic procedures during a live telecast. These annotations may provide the technological framework for send automatic notifications to clinical or operational stakeholders. This technology is a first step in real-time intraoperative decision support, leveraging big data to improve the quality of surgical care, potentially improve surgical outcomes, and support training and education.",

            "chunk": "BACKGROUND: Computational advances in artificial intelligence have led to the recent emergence of U-Net convolutional neural networks (CNNs) applied to medical imaging. Our objectives were to assess the progression of fibrotic interstitial lung disease (ILD) using routine CT scans processed by a U-Net CNN developed by our research team, and to identify a progression threshold indicative of poor prognosis. METHODS: CT scans and clinical history of 32 patients with idiopathic fibrotic ILDs were retrospectively reviewed. Successive CT scans were processed by the U-Net CNN and ILD quantification was obtained. Correlation between ILD and FVC changes was assessed. ROC curve was used to define a threshold of ILD progression rate (PR) to predict poor prognostic (mortality or lung transplantation). The PR threshold was used to compare the cohort survival with Kaplan Mayer curves and log-rank test. RESULTS: The follow-up was 3.8 +/- 1.5 years encompassing 105 CT scans, with 3.3 +/- 1.1 CT scans per patient. A significant correlation between ILD and FVC changes was obtained (p = 0.004, rho = -0.30 [95% CI: -0.16 to -0.45]). Sixteen patients (50%) experienced unfavorable outcome including 13 deaths and 3 lung transplantations. ROC curve analysis showed an aera under curve of 0.83 (p < 0.001), with an optimal cut-off PR value of 4%/year. Patients exhibiting a PR >/= 4%/year during the first two years had a poorer prognosis (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Applying a U-Net CNN to routine CT scan allowed identifying patients with a rapid progression and unfavorable outcome.",

For courses focused on computer coding, such tools are capable for creating working computer code across a range of computer languages and computing platforms. In a course for mechanical engineers focused on C++ coding for the Arduino microcontroller and coding engineering problems in Matlab, a new approach to assessment of programming homework assignments was developed. This assessment moved the focus of assigned points from the correctness of the code to the effort and understanding of the code demonstrated by the student during in-person grading. Students who participated fully in in-person grading did significantly better on a midterm exam. Relative to a previous semester, where grading was focused on correct code, students had a slightly higher average midterm exam score. This approach appears to be effective in supporting computational learning in the face of evolving tools that could be used to circumvent learning. Future work should examine how to also encourage responsible use of generative AI in computational learning.",

            "chunk": "AIM: This scoping review aimed to compile and evaluate clinical trials investigating digital applications in prosthetic diagnostics and treatment planning by assessing their clinical relevance and future potential. METHODS: Following the PCC-framework for scoping reviews and combining the source of analysis (Population/P: \"prosthodontics\"), the technique of interest (Concept/C: \"digital application\") and the field of interest (Context/C: \"diagnostics\"), a three-pronged search strategy was applied in the database PubMed and Web of Science. Clinical trials (>/=10 study participants, English/German) were considered until 2023-03-09. Reporting adhered to the PRISMA-ScR statement. RESULTS: The search identified 520 titles, of which 18 full-texts met the inclusion criteria for data extraction. The trials involved a total of 14,457 study participants and were mapped for prosthetic subdisciplines: fixed (n = 9; 50%) and removable (n = 4; 22%) prosthodontics, reconstructive dentistry in general (n = 3; 17%), and temporo-mandibular joint disorders (n = 2; 11%). Data merging of medical format files, as DICOM+STL, was the dominant digital application (n = 7; 39%); and virtual treatment simulation using digital smile design or digital wax-up represented the most frequent prosthetic diagnostics (n = 6; 33%). CONCLUSION: This scoping review identified a relatively low number of clinical trials. The future potential of digital diagnostics appears to be mostly related to the subdiscipline of fixed prosthodontics, especially regarding virtual treatment simulation for communication with the patient and among dental professionals. Artificial intelligence emerged as a key technology in many of the identified studies. Further research in this area is needed to explore the capabilities of digital technologies in prosthetic diagnostics and treatment planning.",

To demonstrate how advanced NLP can expedite the extraction and analyses of information to help address clinical pharmacology questions, inform clinical trial designs, and support drug development, three use cases are described in this article: (1) dose optimization strategy in oncology, (2) common covariates on pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters in oncology, and (3) physiologically-based PK (PBPK) analyses for regulatory review and product label. The NLP workflow includes (1) preparation of source files, (2) NLP model building, and (3) automation of data extraction. The Clinical Pharmacology and Biopharmaceutics Summary Basis of Approval (SBA) documents, US package inserts (USPI), and approval letters from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) were used as our source data. As demonstrated in the three example use cases, advanced NLP can expedite the extraction and analyses of large amounts of information from regulatory review documents to help address important clinical pharmacology questions.

This research aimed to explore the impact of treatments with AgNO(3) and Ag-NPs on various parameters. The study specifically concentrated on analyzing RAPD profiles and modeling regeneration parameters. The treatments and molecular findings served as input variables in the modeling process. It included the use of AgNO(3) and Ag-NPs at different concentrations (0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 mg L(-1)). The in vitro and epigenetic characteristics were analyzed using several machine learning (ML) methods, including support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), k-nearest neighbor classifier (KNN), and Gaussian processes classifier (GP) methods. This study's results revealed that the highest values for callus induction (CI%) and embryogenic callus induction (EC%) occurred at a concentration of 2 mg L(-1) of Ag-NPs. Additionally, the regeneration efficiency (RE) parameter reached its peak at a concentration of 8 mg L(-1) of AgNO(3). Taking an epigenetic approach, AgNO(3) at a concentration of 2 mg L(-1) demonstrated the highest levels of genomic template stability (GTS), at 79.3%. There was a positive correlation seen between increased levels of AgNO(3) and DNA hypermethylation. Conversely, elevated levels of Ag-NPs were associated with DNA hypomethylation. The models were used to estimate the relationships between the input elements, including treatments, concentration, GTS rates, and Msp I and Hpa II polymorphism, and the in vitro output parameters. The findings suggested that the XGBoost model exhibited superior performance scores for callus induction (CI), as evidenced by an R(2) score of 51.5%, which explained the variances. Additionally, the RF model explained 71.9% of the total variance and showed superior efficacy in terms of EC%. Furthermore, the GP model, which provided the most robust statistics for RE, yielded an R(2) value of 52.5%, signifying its ability to account for a substantial portion of the total variance present in the data. This study exemplifies the application of various machine learning models in the cultivation of mature wheat embryos under the influence of treatments and concentrations involving AgNO(3) and Ag-NPs.",

Short track speed skating, a traditional discipline in the Winter Olympics since its establishment in 1988, has consistently garnered attention. As artificial intelligence continues to advance, the utilization of deep learning methods to enhance athletes' tactical decision-making capabilities has become increasingly prevalent. Traditional tactical decision techniques often rely on the experience and knowledge of coaches and video analysis methods that require a lot of time and effort. Consequently, this study proposes a scientific simulation environment for short track speed skating, that accurately simulates the physical attributes of the venue, the physiological fitness of the athletes, and the rules of the competition. The Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) model is enhanced and utilized, with improvements to the reward function and the distinct description of four tactics. This enables agents to learn optimal tactical decisions in various competitive states with a simulation environment. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach effectively enhances the competition performance and physiological fitness allocation of short track speed skaters.",

This is particularly critical for opaque models such as Deep Neural Networks (DNN), as understanding their decisions is essential, not only for ethical and regulatory compliance, but also for fostering trust in AI-driven outcomes. This paper introduces the novel concept of a Computer Vision Interpretability Index (CVII). The CVII framework is designed to emulate human cognitive processes, specifically in tasks related to vision. It addresses the intricate challenge of quantifying interpretability, a task that is inherently subjective and varies across domains. The CVII is rigorously evaluated using a range of computer vision models applied to the COCO (Common Objects in Context) dataset, a widely recognized benchmark in the field. The findings established a robust correlation between image interpretability, model selection, and CVII scores. This research makes a substantial contribution to enhancing interpretability for human comprehension, as well as within intelligent sensor applications. By promoting transparency and reliability in AI-driven decision-making, the CVII framework empowers its stakeholders to effectively harness the full potential of AI technologies.",

Epileptic seizures, a transient occurrence, are characterized by a spectrum of manifestations, including alterations in motor function and consciousness. These events impose restrictions on the daily lives of those affected, frequently resulting in social isolation and psychological distress. In response, numerous efforts have been directed towards the detection and prevention of epileptic seizures through EEG signal analysis, employing machine learning and deep learning methodologies. This study presents a methodology that reduces the number of features and channels required by simpler classifiers, leveraging Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) for the detection of epileptic seizures. The proposed approach achieves performance metrics exceeding 95% in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score by utilizing merely six features and five channels in a temporal domain analysis, with a time window of 1 s. The model demonstrates robust generalization across the patient cohort included in the database, suggesting that feature reduction in simpler models-without resorting to deep learning-is adequate for seizure detection. The research underscores the potential for substantial reductions in the number of attributes and channels, advocating for the training of models with strategically selected electrodes, and thereby supporting the development of effective mobile applications for epileptic seizure detection.",

This composite sensor model had high diagnostic efficiency (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values: AS, 0.93; MR, 0.80; LVD, 0.75). Notably, the contribution of individual sensors to disease detection was found to be disease-specific, underscoring the synergistic potential of the sensor fusion approach. Thus, machine learning models that integrate auscultation and ECG can efficiently detect conditions typically diagnosed via imaging. Moreover, this study highlights the potential of multimodal artificial intelligence applications.",

This study aimed to clarify objective measures for absolute error and waveform pattern similarity in gait analysis using pose estimation AI (OpenPose). Additionally, we investigated the feasibility of simultaneous measuring both lower limbs using a single camera from one side. We compared motion analysis data from pose estimation AI using video footage that was synchronized with a three-dimensional motion analysis device. The comparisons involved mean absolute error (MAE) and the coefficient of multiple correlation (CMC) to compare the waveform pattern similarity. The MAE ranged from 2.3 to 3.1 degrees  on the camera side and from 3.1 to 4.1 degrees  on the opposite side, with slightly higher accuracy on the camera side. Moreover, the CMC ranged from 0.936 to 0.994 on the camera side and from 0.890 to 0.988 on the opposite side, indicating a \"very good to excellent\" waveform similarity. Gait analysis using a single camera revealed that the precision on both sides was sufficiently robust for clinical evaluation, while measurement accuracy was slightly superior on the camera side.",

Precise estrus period determination is essential to avoid economic losses, such as milk production reductions, delayed calf births, and disqualification from government support. The proposed method integrates estrus period detection with cow identification using augmented reality (AR). It initiates deep learning-based mounting detection, followed by identifying the mounting region of interest (ROI) using YOLOv5. The ROI is then cropped with padding, and cow ID detection is executed using YOLOv5 on the cropped ROI. The system subsequently records the identified cow IDs. The proposed system accurately detects mounting behavior with 99% accuracy, identifies the ROI where mounting occurs with 98% accuracy, and detects the mounting couple with 94% accuracy. The high success of all operations with the proposed system demonstrates its potential contribution to AR and artificial intelligence applications in livestock farming.",

Recently, special attention has been devoted on the clinical setting, where breakdowns in teamwork, leadership, and communication can lead to adverse events, compromising patient safety. So far, researchers have mostly relied on surveys to study human behavior and group dynamics; however, this method is ineffective. In contrast, a promising solution to monitor behavioral and individual features that are reflective of CI is represented by wearable technologies. To date, the field of CI assessment still appears unstructured; therefore, the aim of this narrative review is to provide a detailed overview of the main group and individual parameters that can be monitored to evaluate CI in clinical settings, together with the wearables either already used to assess them or that have the potential to be applied in this scenario. The working principles, advantages, and disadvantages of each device are introduced in order to try to bring order in this field and provide a guide for future CI investigations in medical contexts.",

            "chunk": "Large-scale incorporation of new energy generation units based on renewable sources, such as wind and photovoltaic power, drastically alters the structure of the power system. Because of the intermittent nature of these sources, switching in grids (connection and disconnection) occurs much more frequently than with conventional sources. As a result, the power system will inevitably experience a large number of transients, which raises questions about the stability of the system and the quality of the electrical energy. Therefore, measuring various types of transients in power system is crucial for stability, power quality, fault analysis, protection design, and insulation design. Transient recorders that are currently used are generally expensive and only suitable for particular locations in power systems. The number of installed transient recorders is insufficient for a comprehensive analysis of problems that may occur. Hence, it is important to have inexpensive and efficient transient recorders that can be installed at multiple points in the power system on various types of objects. It is also essential to have a transient record database with open access, which can be used by researchers to develop new analysis techniques based on artificial intelligence. This paper proposes an inexpensive measurement and acquisition system designed to record transient phenomena on different objects within the power system. The system is designed to use autonomous power, a standardized data acquisition module, a low-budget system for transmitting recorded transient events to the server via mobile network, and a sensor system adapted to the object where transients are recorded. The proposed system is designed to be used for all types of objects in the power system where transients may occur, such as power lines, transmission towers, surge arresters, and transformers. All components of the system are described, and the system is tested under laboratory conditions. The modular nature of the system allows customization to the specifics of the location in power system by choosing appropriate components. The calibration method of the custom designed Rogowski coil is described. The cost analysis of the proposed system and power consumption analysis are performed. The results show that the system's performance meets application requirements at a low cost.",

Nothing is worse than parking congestion caused by drivers looking for open spaces. This is common in large parking lots, underground garages, and multi-story car parks, where visibility is limited and signage can be confusing or difficult to read, so drivers have no idea where available parking spaces are. In this paper, a smart real-time parking management system has been introduced. The developed system can deal with the aforementioned challenges by providing dynamic allocation for parking slots while taking into consideration the overall parking situation, providing a mechanism for booking a specific parking slot by using our Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based application, and providing a mechanism to ensure that the car is parked in its correct place. For the sake of providing cost flexibility, we have provided two technical solutions with cost varying. The first solution is developed based on a motion sensor and the second solution is based on a range-finder sensor. A plate detection and recognition system has been used to detect the vehicle's license plate by capturing the image using an IoT device. The system will recognize the extracted English alphabet and Hindu-Arabic Numerals. The proposed solution was built and field-tested to prove the applicability of the proposed smart parking solution.

This unique feature not only simplifies the design process but also ensures the practical implementability of the generated controllers within physical systems. Notably, the GP's functional set extends beyond basic arithmetic operators to include a rich repertoire of mathematical operations, encompassing trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions. This broad set of operations enhances the flexibility and adaptability of the GP-based approach in controller design. To rigorously assess the efficacy of our GP-based approach, we conducted an extensive series of tests to determine its limits and capabilities. In summary, our research establishes the GP-based approach as a promising solution for automating the controller design process, offering a transformative tool to address a spectrum of control problems across various engineering applications.",

This decision is not usually easy, as the computational capacity of the robot, the availability of information through its sensory systems and the characteristics of the environment must be taken into consideration. For this reason, this work focuses on a review of different autonomous-navigation algorithms applied to mobile robots, from which the most suitable ones have been identified for the cases in which the robot must navigate in dynamic environments. Based on the identified algorithms, a comparison of these traditional and DRL-based algorithms was made, using a robotic platform to evaluate their performance, identify their advantages and disadvantages and provide a recommendation for their use, according to the development requirements of the robot. The algorithms selected were DWA, TEB, CADRL and SAC, and the results show that-according to the application and the robot's characteristics-it is recommended to use each of them, based on different conditions.",

It is also a prerequisite for achieving the 'precision' and 'intelligence' that the manufacturing industry aspires to achieve. Industrial microscopes, known for their high accuracy and resolution, have become invaluable tools in the precision measurement of small components. However, these industrial microscopes often struggle to demonstrate their advantages when dealing with complex shapes or large tilt angles. This paper introduces a ray-tracing model for point autofocus microscopy, and it provides the quantified relationship formula between the maximum acceptable tilt angle and the beam offset accepted in point autofocus microscopy, then analyzing the maximum acceptable tilt angle of the objects being measured. This novel approach uses the geometric features of a high-precision reference sphere to simulate the tilt angle and displacement of the surface under investigation. The research findings show that the maximum acceptable tilt angles of a point autofocus microscope vary across different measured directions. Additionally, the extent to which the maximum acceptable tilt angles are affected by the distances of the beam offset also varies. Finally, the difference between the experiment results and the theoretical results is less than 0.5 degrees .",

Their clinical potential, especially in assisting diagnosis and therapy, is the subject of increasingly intensive research. Due to the growing interest in AI for diagnostics, we conducted a study evaluating the abilities of AI models, including ChatGPT, Microsoft Bing, and Scholar AI, in classifying single-curve scoliosis based on radiological descriptions. Fifty-six posturographic images depicting single-curve scoliosis were selected and assessed by two independent neurosurgery specialists, who classified them as mild, moderate, or severe based on Cobb angles. Subsequently, descriptions were developed that accurately characterized the degree of spinal deformation, based on the measured values of Cobb angles. These descriptions were then provided to AI language models to assess their proficiency in diagnosing spinal pathologies. The artificial intelligence models conducted classification using the provided data. Our study also focused on identifying specific sources of information and criteria applied in their decision-making algorithms, aiming for a deeper understanding of the determinants influencing AI decision processes in scoliosis classification. The classification quality of the predictions was evaluated using performance evaluation metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), accuracy, and balanced accuracy. Our study strongly supported our hypothesis, showing that among four AI models, ChatGPT 4 and Scholar AI Premium excelled in classifying single-curve scoliosis with perfect sensitivity and specificity. These models demonstrated unmatched rater concordance and excellent performance metrics. In comparing real and AI-generated scoliosis classifications, they showed impeccable precision in all posturographic images, indicating total accuracy (1.0, MAE = 0.0) and remarkable inter-rater agreement, with a perfect Fleiss' Kappa score. This was consistent across scoliosis cases with a Cobb's angle range of 11-92 degrees. Despite high accuracy in classification, each model used an incorrect angular range for the mild stage of scoliosis. Our findings highlight the immense potential of AI in analyzing medical data sets. However, the diversity in competencies of AI models indicates the need for their further development to more effectively meet specific needs in clinical practice.",

To do so, we compared the real-life situation during the pandemic with the pre-2020 situation. METHODS: This non-interventional, retrospective, observational study applied natural language processing to the electronic health records of the Castilla-La Mancha region of Spain. The analysis was conducted from January 2015 to December 2020. RESULTS: A total of 2592 patients were diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis; 64.6% were males, and the mean age was 53.5 years (95%CI 53.0-54.0). In 2020, pulmonary tuberculosis diagnoses dropped by 28% compared to 2019. In total, 62 (14.2%) patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 and pulmonary tuberculosis coinfection in 2020, with a mean age of 52.3 years (95%CI 48.3-56.2). The main symptoms in these patients were dyspnea (27.4%) and cough (35.5%), although their comorbidities were no greater than patients with isolated TB. The female sex was more frequently affected, representing 53.4% of this patient subgroup. CONCLUSIONS: During the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, a decrease was observed in the incidence of pulmonary tuberculosis. Women presented a significantly higher risk for pulmonary tuberculosis and COVID-19 coinfection, although the symptoms were not more severe than patients diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis alone.",

However, there are still many challenging problems in the development of the theoretical framework, mathematical/physical models, and numerical simulation of fatigue delamination. What is more, it is essential to establish a systematic classification of these methods and models. This article reviews the experimental phenomena of delamination onset and propagation under fatigue loading. The authors reviewed the commonly used phenomenological models for laminated composite structures. The research methods, general modeling formulas, and development prospects of phenomenological models were presented in detail. Based on the analysis of finite element models (FEMs) for laminated composite structures, several simulation methods for fatigue delamination damage models (FDDMs) were carefully classified. Then, the whole procedure, range of applications, capability assessment, and advantages and limitations of the models, which were based on four types of theoretical frameworks, were also discussed in detail. The theoretical frameworks include the strength theory model (SM), fracture mechanics model (FM), damage mechanics model (DM), and hybrid model (HM). To the best of the authors' knowledge, the FDDM based on the modified Paris law within the framework of hybrid fracture and damage mechanics is the most effective method so far. However, it is difficult for the traditional FDDM to solve the problem of the spatial delamination of complex structures. In addition, the balance between the cost of acquiring the model and the computational efficiency of the model is also critical. Therefore, several potential research directions, such as the extended finite element method (XFEM), isogeometric analysis (IGA), phase-field model (PFM), artificial intelligence algorithm, and higher-order deformation theory (HODT), have been presented in the conclusions. Through validation by investigators, these research directions have the ability to overcome the challenging technical issues in the fatigue delamination prediction of laminated composite structures.",

            "chunk": "The increasing prevalence of the Internet of Things (IoT) as the primary networking infrastructure in a future society, driven by a strong focus on sustainability and data, is noteworthy. A significant concern associated with the widespread use of Internet of Things (IoT) devices is the insufficient availability of viable strategies for effectively sustaining their power supply and ensuring their uninterrupted functionality. The ability of RF energy-harvesting systems to externally replenish batteries serves as a primary driver for the development of these technologies. To effectively mitigate concerns related to wireless technology, it is imperative to adhere strictly to the mandated limitations on electromagnetic field emissions. A TA broadband polarization-reconfigurable Y-shaped monopole antenna that is improved with a SADEA-tuned smart metasurface is one technique that has been proposed in order to accomplish this goal. A Y-shaped printed monopole antenna is first taken into consideration. To comprehend the process of polarization reconfigurability transitioning from linear to circular polarization (CP), a BAR 50-02 V RF PIN Diode is employed to shorten one of the parasitic conducting strips to the ground plane. A SADEA-driven metasurface, which utilizes the artificial intelligence-driven surrogate model-assisted differential evolution for antenna synthesis, is devised and positioned beneath the radiator to optimize performance trade-offs while increasing the antenna's gain and bandwidth. The ultimate prototype achieves the following: an impedance bandwidth of 2.58 GHz (3.27-5.85 GHz, 48.45%); an axial bandwidth of 1.25 GHz (4.19-5.44 GHz, 25.96%); a peak gain exceeding 8.45 dBic; and when a highly efficient rectifier is integrated, the maximum RF-DC conversion efficiency of 73.82% and DC output of 5.44 V are obtained. Based on the results mentioned earlier, it is considered appropriate to supply power to intelligent sensors and reduce reliance on batteries via RF energy-harvesting mechanisms implemented in hybrid wireless applications.",

            "chunk": "Point-of-care ultrasound (PoCUS) has become an indispensable standard in emergency medicine. Emergency medicine ultrasound (EMUS) is the application of bedside PoCUS by the attending emergency physician to assist in the diagnosis and management of many time-sensitive health emergencies. In many ways, using PoCUS is not only the mere application of technology, but also a fusion of already existing examiner skills and technology in the context of a patient encounter. EMUS practice can be defined using distinct anatomy-based applications. The type of applications and their complexity usually depend on local needs and resources, and practice patterns can vary significantly among regions, countries, or even continents. A different approach suggests defining EMUS in categories such as resuscitative, diagnostic, procedural guidance, symptom- or sign-based, and therapeutic. Because EMUS is practiced in a constantly evolving emergency medical setting where no two patient encounters are identical, the concept of EMUS should also be practiced in a fluid, constantly adapting manner driven by the physician treating the patient. Many recent advances in ultrasound technology have received little or no attention from the EMUS community, and several important technical advances and research findings have not been translated into routine clinical practice. The authors believe that four main areas have great potential for the future growth and development of EMUS and are worth integrating: 1. In recent years, many articles have been published on novel ultrasound applications. Only a small percentage has found its way into routine use. We will discuss two important examples: trauma ultrasound that goes beyond e-FAST and EMUS lung ultrasound for suspected pulmonary embolism. 2. The more ultrasound equipment becomes financially affordable; the more ultrasound should be incorporated into the physical examination. This merging and possibly even replacement of aspects of the classical physical exam by technology will likely outperform the isolated use of stethoscope, percussion, and auscultation. 3. The knowledge of pathophysiological processes in acute illness and ultrasound findings should be merged in clinical practice. The translation of this knowledge into practical concepts will allow us to better manage many presentations, such as hypotension or the dyspnea of unclear etiology. 4. Technical innovations such as elastography; CEUS; highly sensitive color Doppler such as M-flow, vector flow, or other novel technology; artificial intelligence; cloud-based POCUS functions; and augmented reality devices such as smart glasses should become standard in emergencies over time.",

The involvement of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) is interconnected with survival rates, but may extend even further. The aim of this study is to verify the accuracy of the classical \"naked eye\" count of CD8-positive T cells comprised within the tumoral population and peritumoral infiltrate versus that obtained via a special software run by the aid of artificial intelligence (AI), used to determine the percentage of CD8-positive TILs. Materials and Methods: The present retrospective cross-sectional study conducted over a period of 5 years (2018-2022) focused on patients diagnosed with mucous and/or cutaneous melanoma, with a positive family history for melanoma, or personal antecedents of primary malignant melanocytic lesions. The 23 selected cases were diagnosed histopathologically, tested for CDKN2A mutations through fluorescent hybridization in situ, and CD8 immunohistochemistry was performed. The included slides were evaluated both manually (naked-eye examination) and automatically (via QuPath platform) for quantifying the CD8-positive TILs. Results: The number of CD8-positive TILs in melanoma samples has been more accurately identified through the use of an AI-mediated software as compared to the human-eye evaluation performed by experimental pathologists. A higher percentage of CD8-positive intratumoral lymphocytes versus stromal lymphocytes was positively associated with more numerous metastatic sites. Conclusions: The CD8 lymphocytic phenotype harbors major significance in the context of familial and multiple primary melanoma and may comprise a cost-effective investigation meant to help in the establishment of melanoma prognosis and response to immunotherapy.",

However, research into this topic has been limited to Asian countries. This study aimed to examine the prevalence of psychiatric disorders and sexual differences among juvenile detainees in a detention center in South Korea. Materials and Methods: The participants comprised 54 males and 46 females, with a minimum intelligence score of 80. Psychiatric diagnosis was determined using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Children and Adolescents (MINI-KID). The Massachusetts Youth Screening Instrument-Version 2 (MAYSI-2) was used to investigate gender differences. Results: Using the MINI-KID, the most frequent diseases were conduct disorder (CD), alcohol dependence, suicidal tendency, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), with statistically significant differences between men and women. Only alcohol abuse was higher in males, while the rest were higher in females. The items with a statistically significant gender difference in MAYSI-2 were alcohol/drug use, feeling depressed/anxious, somatic complaints, suicidal ideation, and traumatic experiences. All items for which gender difference was statistically significant were higher in the proportion of women. Conclusions: Juvenile detainees exhibit high rates of psychiatric disorders and comorbidities. CDs, alcohol dependence, and ADHD are the most common psychiatric disorders among juvenile detainees in South Korea. Assessment of and intervention in psychiatric disorders may help prevent further offenses. These findings highlight the importance of diagnosing and intervening in psychiatric disorders within juvenile detention systems.",

            "chunk": "BACKGROUND: Mobile phones, laptops, and computers have become an indispensable part of our lives in recent years. Workers may have an incorrect posture when using a computer for a prolonged period of time. Using these products with an incorrect posture can lead to neck pain. However, there are limited data on postures in real-life situations. METHODS: In this study, we used a common camera to record images of subjects carrying out three different tasks (a typing task, a gaming task, and a video-watching task) on a computer. Different artificial intelligence (AI)-based pose estimation approaches were applied to analyze the head's yaw, pitch, and roll and coordinate information of the eyes, nose, neck, and shoulders in the images. We used machine learning models such as random forest, XGBoost, logistic regression, and ensemble learning to build a model to predict whether a subject had neck pain by analyzing their posture when using the computer. RESULTS: After feature selection and adjustment of the predictive models, nested cross-validation was applied to evaluate the models and fine-tune the hyperparameters. Finally, the ensemble learning approach was utilized to construct a model via bagging, which achieved a performance with 87% accuracy, 92% precision, 80.3% recall, 95.5% specificity, and an AUROC of 0.878. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a predictive model for the identification of non-specific neck pain using 2D video images without the need for costly devices, advanced environment settings, or extra sensors. This method could provide an effective way for clinically evaluating poor posture during real-world computer usage scenarios.",

The underlying causes include the accumulation of beta-amyloid protein (Abeta) in the brain, abnormal phosphorylation, and aggregation of tau protein within nerve cells, as well as neuronal damage and death. Currently, there is no cure for AD with drug therapy. Non-pharmacological interventions such as exercise have been widely used to treat AD, but the specific molecular and biological mechanisms are not well understood. In this narrative review, we integrate the biology of AD and summarize the knowledge of the molecular, neural, and physiological mechanisms underlying exercise-induced improvements in AD progression. We discuss various exercise interventions used in AD and show that exercise directly or indirectly affects the brain by regulating crosstalk mechanisms between peripheral organs and the brain, including \"bone-brain crosstalk\", \"muscle-brain crosstalk\", and \"gut-brain crosstalk\". We also summarize the potential role of artificial intelligence and neuroimaging technologies in exercise interventions for AD. We emphasize that moderate-intensity, regular, long-term exercise may improve the progression of Alzheimer's disease through various molecular and biological pathways, with multimodal exercise providing greater benefits. Through in-depth exploration of the molecular and biological mechanisms and effects of exercise interventions in improving AD progression, this review aims to contribute to the existing knowledge base and provide insights into new therapeutic strategies for managing AD.",

Of all the original radiologist reports, missed OVFs were found in 28.8% of images but were detected using the AI tool. The AI tool demonstrated high specificity of 92.8% (95% CI: 89.6, 95.2%), moderate accuracy of 80.3% (95% CI: 76.3, 80.4%), positive predictive value (PPV) of 73.7% (95% CI: 65.2, 80.8%), and negative predictive value (NPV) of 81.5% (95% CI: 79, 83.8%), but low sensitivity of 49% (95% CI: 40.7, 57.3%). The AI tool showed improved sensitivity compared with the original radiologist reports, which was 20.8% (95% CI: 14.5, 28.4).

Given the rapid developments of dental imaging in the field, the aim of this article is to provide a comprehensive, up-to-date clinical overview of various imaging techniques related to perioperative imaging in third molar surgery, ranging from panoramic radiography to emerging technologies, such as photon-counting computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. Each modality's advantages, limitations, and recent improvements are evaluated, highlighting their role in treatment planning, complication prevention, and postoperative follow-ups. The integration of recent technological advances, including artificial intelligence and machine learning in biomedical imaging, coupled with a thorough preoperative clinical evaluation, marks another step towards personalized dentistry in high-risk third molar surgery. This approach enables minimally invasive surgical approaches while reducing inefficiencies and risks by incorporating additional imaging modality- and patient-specific parameters, potentially facilitating and improving patient management.",

            "chunk": "Multiple myeloma (MM) is a heterogeneous neoplasm accounting for the second most prevalent hematologic disorder. The identification of noninvasive, valuable biomarkers is of utmost importance for the best patient treatment selection, especially in heterogeneous diseases like MM. Despite molecular imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) has achieved a primary role in the characterization of MM, it is not free from shortcomings. In recent years, radiomics and artificial intelligence (AI), which includes machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms, have played an important role in mining additional information from medical images beyond human eyes' resolving power. Our review provides a summary of the current status of radiomics and AI in different clinical contexts of MM. A systematic search of PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus was conducted, including all the articles published in English that explored radiomics and AI analyses of PET/CT images in MM. The initial results have highlighted the potential role of such new features in order to improve the clinical stratification of MM patients, as well as to increase their clinical benefits. However, more studies are warranted before these approaches can be implemented in clinical routines.",

Under conditions of daily clinical practice, our study attempts to identify the differences in the clinical profile of patients with COPD according to age and the impact on the global burden of the disease. This study is non-interventional and observational, using artificial intelligence and data captured from electronic medical records. The study population included patients who were diagnosed with COPD between 2011 and 2021. A total of 73,901 patients had a diagnosis of COPD. The mean age was 73 years (95% CI: 72.9-73.1), and 56,763 were men (76.8%). We observed a specific prevalence of obesity, heart failure, depression, and hiatal hernia in women (p < 0.001), and ischemic heart disease and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in men (p < 0.001). In the analysis by age ranges, a progressive increase in cardiovascular risk factors was observed with age. In conclusion, in a real-life setting, COPD is a disease that primarily affects older subjects and frequently presents with comorbidities that are decisive in the evolutionary course of the disease.",

            "chunk": "We sought to prospectively investigate the accuracy of an artificial intelligence (AI)-based tool for left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) assessment using a hand-held ultrasound device (HUD) in COVID-19 patients and to examine whether reduced LVEF predicts the composite endpoint of in-hospital death, advanced ventilatory support, shock, myocardial injury, and acute decompensated heart failure. COVID-19 patients were evaluated with a real-time LVEF assessment using an HUD equipped with an AI-based tool vs. assessment by a blinded fellowship-trained echocardiographer. Among 42 patients, those with LVEF < 50% were older with more comorbidities and unfavorable exam characteristics. An excellent correlation was demonstrated between the AI and the echocardiographer LVEF assessment (0.774, p < 0.001). Substantial agreement was demonstrated between the two assessments (kappa = 0.797, p < 0.001). The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of the HUD for this threshold were 72.7% 100%, 100%, and 91.2%, respectively. AI-based LVEF < 50% was associated with worse composite endpoints; unadjusted OR = 11.11 (95% CI 2.25-54.94), p = 0.003; adjusted OR = 6.40 (95% CI 1.07-38.09, p = 0.041). An AI-based algorithm incorporated into an HUD can be utilized reliably as a decision support tool for automatic real-time LVEF assessment among COVID-19 patients and may identify patients at risk for unfavorable outcomes. Future larger cohorts should verify the association with outcomes.",

This anomaly presents with intellectual impairment, growth limitations, and distinct facial features. Positive correlation exists between maternal age, particularly in advanced cases, and the global annual incidence is over 200,000 cases. Early interventions, including first and second-trimester screenings, have improved DS diagnosis and care. The manifestations of Down syndrome result from complex interactions between genetic factors linked to various health concerns. To explore recent advancements in Down syndrome research, we focus on the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies for improved diagnosis and management. Recent developments leverage AI and ML algorithms to detect subtle Down syndrome indicators across various data sources, including biological markers, facial traits, and medical images. These technologies offer potential enhancements in accuracy, particularly in cases complicated by cognitive impairments. Integration of AI and ML in Down syndrome diagnosis signifies a significant advancement in medical science. These tools hold promise for early detection, personalized treatment, and a deeper comprehension of the complex interplay between genetics and environmental factors. This review provides a comprehensive overview of neurodevelopmental and cognitive profiles, comorbidities, diagnosis, and management within the Down syndrome context. The utilization of AI and ML represents a transformative step toward enhancing early identification and tailored interventions for individuals with Down syndrome, ultimately improving their quality of life.",

Multiplex fluorescence immunohistochemistry (mfIHC) holds the potential for an improved risk assessment. To enable automated prognosis marker detection (i.e., progesterone receptor [PR], estrogen receptor [ER], androgen receptor [AR], GATA3, TROP2, HER2, PD-L1, Ki67, TOP2A), a framework for automated breast cancer identification was developed and validated involving thirteen different artificial intelligence analysis steps and an algorithm for cell distance analysis using 11+1-marker-BLEACH&STAIN-mfIHC staining in 1404 invasive breast cancers of no special type (NST). The framework for automated breast cancer detection discriminated normal glands from malignant glands with an accuracy of 98.4%. This approach identified that five (PR, ER, AR, GATA3, PD-L1) of nine biomarkers were associated with prolonged overall survival (p </= 0.0095 each) and two of these (PR, AR) were found to be independent risk factors in multivariate analysis (p </= 0.0151 each). The combined assessment of PR-ER-AR-GATA3-PD-L1 as a five-marker prognosis score showed strong prognostic relevance (p < 0.0001) and was an independent risk factor in multivariate analysis (p = 0.0034). Automated breast cancer detection in combination with an artificial intelligence-based analysis of mfIHC enables a rapid and reliable analysis of multiple prognostic parameters. The strict limitation of the analysis to malignant cells excludes the impact of fluctuating tumor purity on assay precision.",

This model screened a library of approximately 700,000 compounds, culminating in the selection of the top 100 candidates for experimental validation. In vitro assays on human intestinal epithelial cells (Caco-2) revealed that 19 of these compounds exhibited inhibitory activity. Notably, eight compounds demonstrated dose-dependent activity in Vero cell lines, with half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) values ranging from 1 muM to 7 muM. Furthermore, we utilized a clustering approach to pinpoint potential nucleoside analog inhibitors, leading to the discovery of two promising candidates: azathioprine and its metabolite, thioinosinic acid. Both compounds showed in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2, with thioinosinic acid also significantly reducing viral loads in mouse lungs. These findings underscore the utility of AI in accelerating drug discovery processes.",

The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) was used for the latter. Thirty-three patients (fourteen men and nineteen women) were included. The scores indicating \"hearing in quiet\" and \"hearing with background noise\" improved significantly one year after CI and remained so two years after CI. The sound localization scores improved two years after CI. The depressive symptoms and perceived stress scores were low at the study's onset and remained unchanged. Working memory improved significantly two years after CI, while processing speed improved significantly one year after CI and was maintained after that.

Their quality of life is adversely impacted by persistent cognitive dysfunction and affective distress, but the underlying neural mechanisms are poorly understood. The present study recruited a group of mostly young, previously healthy adults (24.4 +/- 5.2 years of age) who experienced PASC for almost 6 months following a mild acute COVID-19 illness. Confirming prior evidence, they reported noticeable memory and attention deficits, brain fog, depression/anxiety, fatigue, and other symptoms potentially suggestive of excitation/inhibition imbalance. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) was used to examine the neurochemical aspects of cell signaling with an emphasis on GABA levels in the occipital cortex. The PASC participants were compared to a control (CNT) group matched in demographics, intelligence, and an array of other variables. Controlling for tissue composition, biological sex, and alcohol intake, the PASC group had lower GABA+/water than CNT, which correlated with depression and poor sleep quality. The mediation analysis revealed that the impact of PASC on depression was partly mediated by lower GABA+/water, indicative of cortical hyperexcitability as an underlying mechanism. In addition, N-acetylaspartate (NAA) tended to be lower in the PASC group, possibly suggesting compromised neuronal integrity.

Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) probability distributions were calculated. Cognitive abilities were assessed using the Stanford Binet Intelligence Scales. Reductions in white matter connectivity were detected using DTI in NS patients. The rs-fMRI revealed hyper-connectivity in NS patients between the sensorimotor network and language network and between the sensorimotor network and salience network in comparison to healthy controls. NS patients exhibited decreased verbal and nonverbal IQ compared to healthy controls. The assessment of the microstructural alterations of white matter as well as the resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) analysis in patients with NS may shed light on the mechanisms responsible for cognitive and neurofunctional impairments.",

            "chunk": "Gastrointestinal helminth parasites continue to be a significant threat to the health of equine. OvaCyte Telenostic (OCT) (Telenostic Ltd., Kilkenny, Ireland) has developed an automated digital microscope utilising Artificial Intelligence to identify and count the clinically important helminth species in equine, bovine, and ovine host species. In this paper, the performance of the OCT analyser was evaluated for the detection and counting of equine helminth species parasites and its performance compared to the currently accepted benchmark methods of faecal egg counts being the McMaster and the Mini-FLOTAC techniques. A pairwise comparison of tests was assessed based on the correlation of egg counts and Cohen's kappa agreement statistics for dichotomized outcomes. Bayesian latent class analysis was used to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of all three techniques in the absence of a gold standard for four helminth parasites (strongyles, Anoplocephala spp., Parascaris spp. and Strongyloides westeri). Based on the analysis of 783 equine faecal samples, we found a high level (rho >/= 0.94) of correlation between each pairwise comparison of techniques for strongyle egg counts. Cohen's kappa agreement between techniques was high for strongyles and S. westeri, moderate for Parascaris spp., and low for Anoplocephala spp. All three techniques had a high sensitivity and specificity (>0.90) for strongyles. Across helminth parasites, the sensitivity of the OCT was the highest of the three techniques evaluated for strongyles (0.98 v 0.96 and 0.94), Anoplocephala spp. (0.86 v 0.44 and 0.46) and Parascaris spp. (0.96 v 0.83 and 0.96); but lowest for S. westeri (0.74 v 0.88 and 0.88), compared to McMaster and Mini-FLOTAC, respectively. In terms of specificity, OCT was the lowest in two species (Parascaris spp. 0.96, Anoplocephala spp. 0.95). In conclusion, OCT has a sensitivity and specificity statistically similar to both McMaster and Mini-FLOTAC, and had a higher correlation with Mini-FLOTAC. The OCT point of care faecal analyser offers improved workflow, test turn-around time and does not require trained laboratory personnel to operate or interpret the results.",

            "chunk": "Real-time performance and reliability are two critical indicators in cyber-physical production systems (CPPS). To meet strict requirements in terms of these indicators, it is necessary to solve complex job-shop scheduling problems (JSPs) and reserve considerable redundant resources for unexpected jobs before production. However, traditional job-shop methods are difficult to apply under dynamic conditions due to the uncertain time cost of transmission and computation. Edge computing offers an efficient solution to this issue. By deploying edge servers around the equipment, smart factories can achieve localized decisions based on computational intelligence (CI) methods offloaded from the cloud. Most works on edge computing have studied task offloading and dispatching scheduling based on CI. However, few of the existing methods can be used for behavior-level control due to the corresponding requirements for ultralow latency (10 ms) and ultrahigh reliability (99.9999% in wireless transmission), especially when unexpected computing jobs arise. Therefore, this paper proposes a dynamic resource prediction scheduling (DRPS) method based on CI to achieve real-time localized behavior-level control. The proposed DRPS method primarily focuses on the schedulability of unexpected computing jobs, and its core ideas are (1) to predict job arrival times based on a backpropagation neural network and (2) to perform real-time migration in the form of human-computer interaction based on the results of resource analysis. An experimental comparison with existing schemes shows that our DRPS method improves the acceptance ratio by 25.9% compared to the earliest deadline first scheme.",

            "chunk": "Deep learning is one of the most exciting and promising techniques in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), which drives AI applications to be more intelligent and comprehensive. However, existing deep learning techniques usually require a large amount of expensive labeled data, which limit the application and development of deep learning techniques, and thus it is imperative to study unsupervised machine learning. The learning of deep representations by mutual information estimation and maximization (Deep InfoMax or DIM) method has achieved unprecedented results in the field of unsupervised learning. However, in the DIM method, to restrict the encoder to learn more normalized feature representations, an adversarial network learning method is used to make the encoder output consistent with a priori positively distributed data. As we know, the model training of the adversarial network learning method is difficult to converge, because there is a logarithmic function in the loss function of the cross-entropy measure, and the gradient of the model parameters is susceptible to the \"gradient explosion\" or \"gradient disappearance\" phenomena, which makes the training of the DIM method extremely unstable. In this regard, we propose a Wasserstein distance-based DIM method to solve the stability problem of model training, and our method is called the WDIM. Subsequently, the training stability of the WDIM method and the classification ability of unsupervised learning are verified on the CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and STL10 datasets. The experiments show that our proposed WDIM method is more stable to parameter updates, has faster model convergence, and at the same time, has almost the same accuracy as the DIM method on the classification task of unsupervised learning. Finally, we also propose a reflection of future research for the WDIM method, aiming to provide a research idea and direction for solving the image classification task with unsupervised learning.",

            "chunk": "Research on Explainable Artificial Intelligence has recently started exploring the idea of producing explanations that, rather than being expressed in terms of low-level features, are encoded in terms of interpretable concepts learned from data. How to reliably acquire such concepts is, however, still fundamentally unclear. An agreed-upon notion of concept interpretability is missing, with the result that concepts used by both post hoc explainers and concept-based neural networks are acquired through a variety of mutually incompatible strategies. Critically, most of these neglect the human side of the problem: a representation is understandable only insofar as it can be understood by the human at the receiving end. The key challenge in human-interpretable representation learning (hrl) is how to model and operationalize this human element. In this work, we propose a mathematical framework for acquiring interpretable representations suitable for both post hoc explainers and concept-based neural networks. Our formalization of hrl builds on recent advances in causal representation learning and explicitly models a human stakeholder as an external observer. This allows us derive a principled notion of alignment between the machine's representation and the vocabulary of concepts understood by the human. In doing so, we link alignment and interpretability through a simple and intuitive name transfer game, and clarify the relationship between alignment and a well-known property of representations, namely disentanglement. We also show that alignment is linked to the issue of undesirable correlations among concepts, also known as concept leakage, and to content-style separation, all through a general information-theoretic reformulation of these properties. Our conceptualization aims to bridge the gap between the human and algorithmic sides of interpretability and establish a stepping stone for new research on human-interpretable representations.",

Referred to as the \"silent killer,\" ovarian cancer exhibits inconspicuous symptoms during its initial phases, posing a challenge for timely identification. Identification of ovarian cancer during its advanced stages significantly diminishes the likelihood of effective treatment and survival. Regular screenings, such as pelvic exams, ultrasound, and blood tests for specific biomarkers, are essential tools for detecting the disease in its early, more treatable stages. This research makes use of the Soochow University ovarian cancer dataset, containing 50 features for the accurate detection of ovarian cancer. The proposed predictive model makes use of a stacked ensemble model, merging the strengths of bagging and boosting classifiers, and aims to enhance predictive accuracy and reliability. This combination harnesses the benefits of variance reduction and improved generalization, contributing to superior ovarian cancer prediction outcomes. The proposed model gives 96.87% accuracy, which is currently the highest model result obtained on this dataset so far using all features. Moreover, the outcomes are elucidated utilizing the explainable artificial intelligence method referred to as SHAPly. The excellence of the suggested model is demonstrated through a comparison of its performance with that of other cutting-edge models.",

            "chunk": "PURPOSE: When autocontouring based on artificial intelligence (AI) is used in the radiotherapy (RT) workflow, the contours are reviewed and eventually adjusted by a radiation oncologist before an RT treatment plan is generated, with the purpose of improving dosimetry and reducing both interobserver variability and time for contouring. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the results of application of a commercial AI-based autocontouring for RT, assessing both geometric accuracies and the influence on optimized dose from automatically generated contours after review by human operator. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A commercial autocontouring system was applied to a retrospective database of 40 patients, of which 20 were treated with radiotherapy for prostate cancer (PCa) and 20 for head and neck cancer (HNC). Contours resulting from AI were compared against AI contours reviewed by human operator and human-only contours using Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), Hausdorff distance (HD), and relative volume difference (RVD). Dosimetric indices such as D(mean), D(0.03cc), and normalized plan quality metrics were used to compare dose distributions from RT plans generated from structure sets contoured by humans assisted by AI against plans from manual contours. The reduction in contouring time obtained by using automated tools was also assessed. A Wilcoxon rank sum test was computed to assess the significance of differences. Interobserver variability of the comparison of manual vs. AI-assisted contours was also assessed among two radiation oncologists for PCa. RESULTS: For PCa, AI-assisted segmentation showed good agreement with expert radiation oncologist structures with average DSC among patients >/= 0.7 for all structures, and minimal radiation oncology adjustment of structures (DSC of adjusted versus AI structures >/= 0.91). For HNC, results of comparison between manual and AI contouring varied considerably e.g., 0.77 for oral cavity and 0.11-0.13 for brachial plexus, but again, adjustment was generally minimal (DSC of adjusted against AI contours 0.97 for oral cavity, 0.92-0.93 for brachial plexus). The difference in dose for the target and organs at risk were not statistically significant between human and AI-assisted, with the only exceptions of D(0.03cc) to the anal canal and D(mean) to the brachial plexus. The observed average differences in plan quality for PCa and HNC cases were 8% and 6.7%, respectively. The dose parameter changes due to interobserver variability in PCa were small, with the exception of the anal canal, where large dose variations were observed. The reduction in time required for contouring was 72% for PCa and 84% for HNC. CONCLUSIONS: When an autocontouring system is used in combination with human review, the time of the RT workflow is significantly reduced without affecting dose distribution and plan quality.",

A total of 379 women and their children from the Alberta Pregnancy Outcomes and Nutrition (APrON) study participated. Covariate-adjusted robust regressions examined associations between maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, GWG class, interaction terms, and child outcomes. Each unit increase in maternal BMI was linked to a 0.48-point decrement (95% CI: -0.75 to -0.21) in children's Full Scale IQ. Higher pre-pregnancy BMI was related to poorer performance on the other intelligence indexes (B = -0.35 to -0.47, 95% CIs: -0.75, -0.02) and lower performance on measures of language (B = -0.08 to -0.09, 95% CIs: -0.16, -0.02), motor skills (B = -0.08 to -0.11, 95% CIs: -0.18, -0.01), and executive function (B = -0.09 to -0.16, 95% CIs: -0.26, -0.01). GWG below the recommended range was associated with a 4.04-point decrement (95% CI: 7.89, -0.11) in Full Scale IQ, but better performance on a spatial working memory test (B = 0.27, 95% CI: 0.02, 0.52). GWG above the recommended range was associated with lower language (B = -0.79, 95% CI: -1.52, -0.06) and memory scores (B = -0.93, 95% CI: -1.64, -0.22). Interactions were found between pre-pregnancy BMI and GWG on measures of intelligence and executive function. Maternal pre-pregnancy BMI and GWG are related to children's performance in various neuropsychological domains and may interact to predict outcomes. Optimizing maternal health and weight prior to conception and during pregnancy may enhance children's neuropsychological outcomes.",

Traditional semi-automatic approaches are time-consuming and operator-dependent, although they provide reliable outcomes. Moreover, the recent expansion of artificial intelligence (AI) tools towards various medical domains is transforming modern healthcare. Accordingly, this study introduces an automated AI-based pipeline to replace the current operator-based tibia and femur 3D reconstruction procedure enhancing TKA preoperative planning. Leveraging an 822 CT image dataset, a novel patch-based method and an improved segmentation label generation algorithm were coupled to a Combined Edge Loss UNet (CEL-UNet), a novel CNN architecture featuring an additional decoding branch to boost the bone boundary segmentation. Root Mean Squared Errors and Hausdorff distances compared the predicted surfaces to the reference bones showing median and interquartile values of 0.26 (0.19-0.36) mm and 0.24 (0.18-0.32) mm, and of 1.06 (0.73-2.15) mm and 1.43 (0.82-2.86) mm for the tibia and femur, respectively, outperforming previous results of our group, state-of-the-art, and UNet models. A feasibility analysis for a PSI-based surgical plan revealed sub-millimetric distance errors and sub-angular alignment uncertainties in the PSI contact areas and the two cutting planes. Finally, operational environment testing underscored the pipeline's efficiency. More than half of the processed cases complied with the PSI prototyping requirements, reducing the overall time from 35 min to 13.1 s, while the remaining ones underwent a manual refinement step to achieve such PSI requirements, performing the procedure four to eleven times faster than the manufacturer standards. To conclude, this research advocates the need for real-world applicability and optimization of AI solutions in orthopedic surgical practice.",

Computed tomography (CT)-based preoperative planning offers more comprehensive information and can also be used to design patient-specific instrumentation (PSI), but it requires well-reconstructed and segmented images, and the process is complex and time-consuming. This study aimed to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) preoperative planning and PSI system for TKA and to validate its time savings and accuracy in clinical applications. METHODS: The 3D-UNet and modified HRNet neural network structures were used to develop the AI preoperative planning and PSI system (AIJOINT). Forty-two patients who were scheduled for TKA underwent both AI and manual CT processing and planning for component sizing, 20 of whom had their PSIs designed and applied intraoperatively. The time consumed and the size and orientation of the postoperative component were recorded. RESULTS: The Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and loss function indicated excellent performance of the neural network structure in CT image segmentation. AIJOINT was faster than conventional methods for CT segmentation (3.74 +/- 0.82 vs. 128.88 +/- 17.31 min, p < 0.05) and PSI design (35.10 +/- 3.98 vs. 159.52 +/- 17.14 min, p < 0.05) without increasing the time for size planning. The accuracy of AIJOINT in planning the size of both femoral and tibial components was 92.9%, while the accuracy of the conventional method in planning the size of the femoral and tibial components was 42.9% and 47.6%, respectively (p < 0.05). In addition, AI-based PSI improved the accuracy of the hip-knee-ankle angle and reduced postoperative blood loss (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: AIJOINT significantly reduces the time needed for CT processing and PSI design without increasing the time for size planning, accurately predicts the component size, and improves the accuracy of lower limb alignment in TKA patients, providing a meaningful supplement to the application of AI in orthopaedics.",

            "chunk": "In recent years, nanomedicines prepared using supercritical technology have garnered widespread research attention due to their inherent attributes, including structural stability, high bioavailability, and commendable safety profiles. The preparation of these nanomedicines relies upon drug solubility and mixing efficiency within supercritical fluids (SCFs). Solubility is closely intertwined with operational parameters such as temperature and pressure while mixing efficiency is influenced not only by operational conditions but also by the shape and dimensions of the nozzle. Due to the special conditions of supercriticality, these parameters are difficult to measure directly, thus presenting significant challenges for the preparation and optimization of nanomedicines. Mathematical models can, to a certain extent, prognosticate solubility, while simulation models can visualize mixing efficiency during experimental procedures, offering novel avenues for advancing supercritical nanomedicines. Consequently, within the framework of this endeavor, we embark on an extensive review encompassing the application of mathematical models, artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies, and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques within the medical domain of supercritical technology. We undertake the synthesis and discourse of methodologies for calculating drug solubility in SCFs, as well as the influence of operational conditions and experimental apparatus upon the outcomes of nanomedicine preparation using supercritical technology. Through this comprehensive review, we elucidate the implementation procedures and commonly employed models of diverse methodologies, juxtaposing the merits and demerits of these models. Furthermore, we assert the dependability of employing models to compute drug solubility in SCFs and simulate the experimental processes, with the capability to serve as valuable tools for aiding and optimizing experiments, as well as providing guidance in the selection of appropriate operational conditions. This, in turn, fosters innovative avenues for the development of supercritical pharmaceuticals.",

However, the presence of Protected Health Information (PHI) in medical data poses a challenge when it comes to sharing. One potential solution to mitigate the risk of PHI breaches is to exclusively share pre-trained models developed using private datasets. Despite the availability of these pre-trained networks, there remains a need for an adaptable environment to test and fine-tune specific models tailored for clinical tasks. This environment should be open for peer testing, feedback, and continuous model refinement, allowing dynamic model updates that are especially important in the medical field, where diseases and scanning techniques evolve rapidly. In this context, the Discovery Viewer (DV) platform was developed in-house at the Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Institute at Mount Sinai (BMEII) to facilitate the creation and distribution of cutting-edge medical AI models that remain accessible after their development. The all-in-one platform offers a unique environment for non-AI experts to learn, develop, and share their own deep learning (DL) concepts. This paper presents various use cases of the platform, with its primary goal being to demonstrate how DV holds the potential to empower individuals without expertise in AI to create high-performing DL models. We tasked three non-AI experts to develop different musculoskeletal AI projects that encompassed segmentation, regression, and classification tasks. In each project, 80% of the samples were provided with a subset of these samples annotated to aid the volunteers in understanding the expected annotation task. Subsequently, they were responsible for annotating the remaining samples and training their models through the platform's \"Training Module\". The resulting models were then tested on the separate 20% hold-off dataset to assess their performance. The classification model achieved an accuracy of 0.94, a sensitivity of 0.92, and a specificity of 1. The regression model yielded a mean absolute error of 14.27 pixels. And the segmentation model attained a Dice Score of 0.93, with a sensitivity of 0.9 and a specificity of 0.99. This initiative seeks to broaden the community of medical AI model developers and democratize the access of this technology to all stakeholders. The ultimate goal is to facilitate the transition of medical AI models from research to clinical settings.",

We aimed to evaluate the performance of the first scanner-integrated artificial intelligence algorithm to detect brain hemorrhages in a routine clinical setting. This retrospective study includes 435 consecutive non-contrast head CT scans. Automatic brain hemorrhage detection was calculated as a separate reconstruction job in all cases. The radiological report (RR) was always conducted by a radiology resident and finalized by a senior radiologist. Additionally, a team of two radiologists reviewed the datasets retrospectively, taking additional information like the clinical record, course, and final diagnosis into account. This consensus reading served as a reference. Statistics were carried out for diagnostic accuracy. Brain hemorrhage detection was executed successfully in 432/435 (99%) of patient cases. The AI algorithm and reference standard were consistent in 392 (90.7%) cases. One false-negative case was identified within the 52 positive cases. However, 39 positive detections turned out to be false positives. The diagnostic performance was calculated as a sensitivity of 98.1%, specificity of 89.7%, positive predictive value of 56.7%, and negative predictive value (NPV) of 99.7%. The execution of scanner-integrated AI detection of brain hemorrhages is feasible and robust. The diagnostic accuracy has a high specificity and a very high negative predictive value and sensitivity.

Approaching tooth samples having cracks from different perspectives and using complementary laboratory techniques, there is a natural progression from 3D to multi-modal imaging, where the volumetric (passive: dimensions) information of the tooth sample can be supplemented by dynamic (active: composition, interaction) image data. Revelation of tooth cracks clearly shows the need to re-assess the role of these MCs and their effect on the structural integrity and longevity of the tooth. This provides insight into the nature of cracks in natural hard materials and contributes to a better understanding of how bio-inspired structures could be designed to foresee crack propagation in biosolids.",

Copy number variation (CNV) contributed to VACTERL pathogenicity. Here, we report a novel CNV in 8p23 and 12q23.1 identified in a case of ARMs-related VACTERL association. This 12-year-old girl presented a cloaca (urethra, vagina, and rectum opening together and sharing a single tube length), an isolated kidney, and a perpetuation of the left superior vena cava at birth. Her intelligence, growth, and development were slightly lower than those of normal children of the same age. Array comparative genomic hybridization revealed a 9.6-Mb deletion in 8p23.1-23.3 and a 0.52-Mb duplication in 12q23.1 in her genome. Furthermore, we reviewed the cases involving CNVs in patients with VACTERL, 8p23 deletion, and 12q23.1 duplication, and our case was the first displaying ARMs-related VACTERL association with CNV in 8p23 and 12q23.1. These findings enriched our understanding between VACTERL association and the mutations of 8p23 deletion and 12q23.1 duplication. IMPACT: This is a novel case of a Chinese girl with anorectal malformations (ARMs)-related VACTERL with an 8p23.1-23.3 deletion and 12q23.1 duplication. Cloaca malformation is presented with novel copy number variation in 8p23.1-23.3 deletion and 12q23.1 duplication.",

This study aimed to assess the performance of an AI software deployed within the diabetic retinopathy screening programme in Dominica. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We conducted a prospective, cross-sectional clinical validation study. Patients with diabetes aged 18 years and above attending the diabetic retinopathy screening in primary care facilities in Dominica from 5 June to 3 July 2021 were enrolled.Grading was done at the point of care by the field grader, followed by counselling and referral to the eye clinic. Images were then graded by an AI system. Sensitivity, specificity with 95% CIs and area under the curve (AUC) were calculated for comparing the AI to field grader as gold standard. RESULTS: A total of 587 participants were screened. The AI had a sensitivity and specificity for detecting referable diabetic retinopathy of 77.5% and 91.5% compared with the grader, for all participants, including ungradable images. The AUC was 0.8455. Excluding 52 participants deemed ungradable by the grader, the AI had a sensitivity and specificity of 81.4% and 91.5%, with an AUC of 0.9648. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that AI has the potential to be deployed to assist a diabetic screening programme in a middle-income real-world setting and perform with reasonable accuracy compared with a specialist grader.",

            "chunk": "PURPOSE: To develop a Vision Transformer model to detect different stages of diabetic maculopathy (DM) based on optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. METHODS: After removing images with poor quality, a total of 3319 OCT images were extracted from the Eye Center of the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University and randomly split the images into training and validation sets in a 7:3 ratio. All macular cross-sectional scan OCT images were collected retrospectively from the eyes of DM patients from 2016 to 2022. One of the OCT stages of DM, including early diabetic macular oedema (DME), advanced DME, severe DME and atrophic maculopathy, was labelled on the collected images, respectively. A deep learning (DL) model based on Vision Transformer was trained to detect four OCT grading of DM. RESULTS: The model proposed in our paper can provide an impressive detection performance. We achieved an accuracy of 82.00%, an F1 score of 83.11%, an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.96. The AUC for the detection of four OCT grading (ie, early DME, advanced DME, severe DME and atrophic maculopathy) was 0.96, 0.95, 0.87 and 0.98, respectively, with an accuracy of 90.87%, 89.96%, 94.42% and 95.13%, respectively, a precision of 88.46%, 80.31%, 89.42% and 87.74%, respectively, a sensitivity of 87.03%, 88.18%, 63.39% and 89.42%, respectively, a specificity of 93.02%, 90.72%, 98.40% and 96.66%, respectively and an F1 score of 87.74%, 84.06%, 88.18% and 88.57%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Our DL model based on Vision Transformer demonstrated a relatively high accuracy in the detection of OCT grading of DM, which can help with patients in a preliminary screening to identify groups with serious conditions. These patients need a further test for an accurate diagnosis, and a timely treatment to obtain a good visual prognosis. These results emphasised the potential of artificial intelligence in assisting clinicians in developing therapeutic strategies with DM in the future.",

It therefore represents both a global public health threat and a precision medicine challenge. A artificial intelligence (AI) is being investigated in MASLD to develop reproducible, quantitative, and automated methods to enhance patient stratification and to discover new biomarkers and therapeutic targets in MASLD. This review details the different applications of AI and machine learning algorithms in MASLD, particularly in analyzing electronic health record, digital pathology, and imaging data. Additionally, it also describes how specific MASLD consortia are leveraging multimodal data sources to spark research breakthroughs in the field.

We aimed to clarify the challenges of magnification, staining methods, and false positives in creating general purpose deep learning-based cytology models. METHODS: Using 11 types of human cancer cell lines, we prepared Papanicolaou- and May-Grunwald-Giemsa (MGG)-stained specimens. We created deep learning models with different cell types, staining, and magnifications from each cell image using the You Only Look Once, version 8 (YOLOv8) algorithm. Detection and classification rates were calculated to compare the models. RESULTS: The classification rates of all the created models were over 95.9%. The highest detection rates of the Papanicolaou and MGG models were 92.3% and 91.3%, respectively. The highest detection rates of the object detection and instance segmentation models, which were 11 cell types with Papanicolaou staining, were 94.6% and 91.7%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We believe that the artificial intelligence technology of YOLOv8 has sufficient performance for applications in screening and cell classification in clinical settings. Conducting research to demonstrate the efficacy of YOLOv8 artificial intelligence technology on clinical specimens is crucial for overcoming the unique challenges associated with cytology.",

Pandemic-influenced changes in the employment relationship highlighting the need for adaptation in order to facilitate a return to pre-pandemic conditions. Crises such as this can have a detrimental effect on employees' psychological contract, which in turn can hinder the organization's ability to thrive in the post-COVID-19 era and impede the development of high commitment levels in the aftermath of the crisis. Emotional intelligence plays an increasingly vital role in effectively navigating the crisis and providing support to employees, while also facilitating the reconstruction of the psychological contract. Therefore, this study aims to explain the role of emotional intelligence of strategic human resource management practitioners on affective organizational commitment and the possible mediating effect of the psychological contract in that relationship. A quantitative study took place in February 2023 among 286 HR directors, HR managers, and HR officers in higher education institutions in Georgia. Partial Least Squares for Structural Equation Modelling was applied for data analysis. The results revealed that the emotional intelligence of strategic human resource management practitioners has a positive impact on the psychological contract and the affective organizational commitment. This study supports the idea that emotional intelligence can transform strategic human resource management practitioners into individuals who engage in people-orientated activities. These activities aim to effectively acquire, utilize, and retain employees within an organization. The study also suggests that emotional intelligence can provide solutions to maintain high employee commitment during times of crisis and in the aftermath of unprecedented situations.",

This study aimed to develop an AI algorithm that detects vocal cords from VL images acquired during emergent situations. This retrospective study used VL images acquired in the emergency department to facilitate the ETI. The vocal cord image was labeled with a ground-truth bounding box. The dataset was divided into training and validation datasets. The algorithm was developed from a training dataset using the YOLOv4 model. The performance of the algorithm was evaluated using a test set. The test set was further divided into specific environments during the ETI for clinical subgroup analysis. In total, 20,161 images from 84 patients were used in this study. A total of 10,287, 5766, and 4108 images were used for the model training, validation, and test sets, respectively. The developed algorithm achieved F1 score 0.906, sensitivity 0.963, and specificity 0.842 in the validation set. The performance in the test set was F1 score 0.808, sensitivity 0.823, and specificity 0.804. We developed and validated an AI algorithm to detect vocal cords in VL.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate Chinese nursing students' AIQ and employability status as well as their cognition and demand for the latest AI tool-ChatGPT. This study was conducted to guide future initiatives in nursing intelligence education and to improve the employability of nursing students. METHODS: We used a cross-sectional survey to understand nursing college students' AIQ, employability, cognition, and demand for ChatGPT. Using correlation analysis and multiple hierarchical regression analysis, we explored the relevant factors in the employability of nursing college students. RESULTS: In this study, out of 1788 students, 1453 (81.30%) had not used ChatGPT, and 1170 (65.40%) had never heard of ChatGPT before this survey. College students' employability scores were positively correlated with AIQ, self-regulation ability, and their home location and negatively correlated with school level. Additionally, men scored higher on college students' employability compared to women. Furthermore, 76.5% of the variance was explained by the multiple hierarchical regression model for predicting college students' employability scores. CONCLUSIONS: Chinese nursing students have limited familiarity and experience with ChatGPT, while their AIQ remains intermediate. Thus, educators should pay more attention to cultivating nursing students' AIQ and self-regulation ability to enhance their employability. Employability, especially for female students, those from rural backgrounds, and students in key colleges, deserves more attention in future educational efforts.",

            "chunk": "BACKGROUND: Recent advances in hardware and software enabled the use of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for analysis of complex data in a wide range of daily-life use cases. We aim to explore the benefits of applying AI to a specific use case in transplant nephrology: risk prediction for severe posttransplant events. For the first time, we combine multinational real-world transplant data, which require specific legal and technical protection measures. OBJECTIVE: The German-Canadian NephroCAGE consortium aims to develop and evaluate specific processes, software tools, and methods to (1) combine transplant data of more than 8000 cases over the past decades from leading transplant centers in Germany and Canada, (2) implement specific measures to protect sensitive transplant data, and (3) use multinational data as a foundation for developing high-quality prognostic AI models. METHODS: To protect sensitive transplant data addressing the first and second objectives, we aim to implement a decentralized NephroCAGE federated learning infrastructure upon a private blockchain. Our NephroCAGE federated learning infrastructure enables a switch of paradigms: instead of pooling sensitive data into a central database for analysis, it enables the transfer of clinical prediction models (CPMs) to clinical sites for local data analyses. Thus, sensitive transplant data reside protected in their original sites while the comparable small algorithms are exchanged instead. For our third objective, we will compare the performance of selected AI algorithms, for example, random forest and extreme gradient boosting, as foundation for CPMs to predict severe short- and long-term posttransplant risks, for example, graft failure or mortality. The CPMs will be trained on donor and recipient data from retrospective cohorts of kidney transplant patients. RESULTS: We have received initial funding for NephroCAGE in February 2021. All clinical partners have applied for and received ethics approval as of 2022. The process of exploration of clinical transplant database for variable extraction has started at all the centers in 2022. In total, 8120 patient records have been retrieved as of August 2023. The development and validation of CPMs is ongoing as of 2023. CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, we will (1) combine kidney transplant data from nephrology centers in Germany and Canada, (2) implement federated learning as a foundation to use such real-world transplant data as a basis for the training of CPMs in a privacy-preserving way, and (3) develop a learning software system to investigate population specifics, for example, to understand population heterogeneity, treatment specificities, and individual impact on selected posttransplant outcomes.

            "chunk": "BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize the way medicine is learned, taught, and practiced, and medical education must prepare learners for these inevitable changes. Academic medicine has, however, been slow to embrace recent AI advances. Since its launch in November 2022, ChatGPT has emerged as a fast and user-friendly large language model that can assist health care professionals, medical educators, students, trainees, and patients. While many studies focus on the technology's capabilities, potential, and risks, there is a gap in studying the perspective of end users. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to gauge the experiences and perspectives of graduating medical students on ChatGPT and AI in their training and future careers. METHODS: A cross-sectional web-based survey of recently graduated medical students was conducted in an international academic medical center between May 5, 2023, and June 13, 2023. Descriptive statistics were used to tabulate variable frequencies. RESULTS: Of 325 applicants to the residency programs, 265 completed the survey (an 81.5% response rate). The vast majority of respondents denied using ChatGPT in medical school, with 20.4% (n=54) using it to help complete written assessments and only 9.4% using the technology in their clinical work (n=25). More students planned to use it during residency, primarily for exploring new medical topics and research (n=168, 63.4%) and exam preparation (n=151, 57%). Male students were significantly more likely to believe that AI will improve diagnostic accuracy (n=47, 51.7% vs n=69, 39.7%; P=.001), reduce medical error (n=53, 58.2% vs n=71, 40.8%; P=.002), and improve patient care (n=60, 65.9% vs n=95, 54.6%; P=.007). Previous experience with AI was significantly associated with positive AI perception in terms of improving patient care, decreasing medical errors and misdiagnoses, and increasing the accuracy of diagnoses (P=.001, P<.001, P=.008, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The surveyed medical students had minimal formal and informal experience with AI tools and limited perceptions of the potential uses of AI in health care but had overall positive views of ChatGPT and AI and were optimistic about the future of AI in medical education and health care. Structured curricula and formal policies and guidelines are needed to adequately prepare medical learners for the forthcoming integration of AI in medicine.",

            "chunk": "Groundwater is widely recognized as a vital source of fresh drinking water worldwide. However, the rapid, unregulated population growth and increased industrialization, coupled with a rise in human activities, have significantly harmed the quality of groundwater. Changes in the local topography and drainage systems in an area have negative impacts on both the quality and quantity of groundwater. This underscores the critical need to assess the susceptibility of groundwater to pollution and implement measures to mitigate these risks. The water quality index (WQI) is an approach that simulates the water quality at peculiar locations for a particular period of time. The artificial neural network (ANN) model approach is such an idealistic methodology that can be utilized for WQI development and provides better results for specific locations in optimum time. Therefore, the goal of the current study is to provide a unique way for using artificial neural networks (ANN) to characterize the groundwater quality of Delhi Metropolitan City, India. In order to make the water fit for residential and drinking use, the research also pinpoints the geographical variability and spots where the contaminated region has to be sufficiently cleaned. A minimum WQI of 41.51 was obtained at the Jagatpur location while a maximum value of 779.01 was at the Peeragarhi location. During the training phase, the results obtained using the ANN model were highly favorable, demonstrating a strong association with an R-value of 98.10%, thus highlighting the program's exceptional efficiency. However, in accordance with the correlation regression findings, the prediction outcomes of the ANN model in testing are observed to be an R-value of 99.99-100%. This study confirms the promise and advantages of employing advanced artificial intelligence in managing groundwater quality in the studied area.",

            "chunk": "In stand-alone power systems, technical, economic, and environmental (TEE) assessment of hybrid energy systems under uncertainty is an important issue. This paper focuses on the TEE assessment of a stand-alone hybrid energy system composed of photovoltaic (PV) and diesel generator (DG) with/without battery energy storage (BS) in remote islands in China. So, determining the optimal sizes of PV and DG with/without BS for economic, reliable, and efficient operation of a hybrid power system in a microgrid is important. For this goal, a modified swarm intelligence algorithm is used to optimize, techno-economic feasibility and avoid potential CO(2) emission. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the modified swarm intelligence algorithm, it is compared with the standard swarm intelligence method and simple simulated annealing method in terms of operational cost reduction and power loss reduction. The aim of the optimization is to minimize the cost of a stand-alone solar power system based on diesel engine with/without battery energy storage system by optimal determination of the load uncertainty and CO(2) emission. The optimal results are developed further by performing sensitivity analysis, such as the effect of the fuel cost and the penalty cost of CO(2) emission. Over the case study, simulation results show that the proposed algorithm obtains more promising results in terms of TEE aspects. The reliability, low carbon, and cost-effectiveness of stand-alone solar power systems based on diesel engine with battery energy storage system can be easily calculated using the correlations derived in this analysis. The resulting cost of energy is in the range of 0.2845 to 0.6492 $/kWh.",

METHODS: A total of 2 prompts were provided to ChatGPT to generate IC documents. Four board-certified plastic surgeons and 4 nonmedical staff members evaluated the AI-generated IC documents and the original IC document currently used in the clinical setting. They assessed these documents in terms of accuracy, informativeness, and accessibility. RESULTS: Among board-certified plastic surgeons, the initial AI-generated IC document scored significantly lower than the original IC document in accuracy (p < 0.001), informativeness (p = 0.005), and accessibility (p = 0.021), while the revised AI-generated IC document scored lower compared with the original document in accuracy (p = 0.03) and accessibility (p = 0.021). Among nonmedical staff members, no statistical significance of 2 AI-generated IC documents was observed compared with the original document in terms of accuracy, informativeness, and accessibility. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that current ChatGPT cannot be used as a distinct patient education resource. However, it has the potential to make better IC documents when improving the professional terminology. This AI technology will eventually transform ophthalmic plastic surgery healthcare systematics by enhancing patient education and decision-making via IC documents.",

In total, 441 lungs (180 healthy and 261 diseased) are included in this study. Each lung was scored according to traditional methods, which represent the gold standard (Madec's and Christensen's grids). Moreover, the same lungs were photographed and thereafter scored by a trained convolutional neural network. Overall, the results reveal that the convolutional neural network is very specific (95.55%) and quite sensitive (85.05%), showing a rather high correlation when compared with the scores provided by a skilled veterinarian (Spearman's coefficient = 0.831, p < 0.01).

Implemented in the form of multiplexed total DNA metagenomics or as total RNA sequencing, the approach produces comprehensive and actionable reports that allow semi-quantitative identification of most of the agents present in respiratory, cloacal, and tissue samples. The diagnostic benefits of the use of direct tNGS and ntNGS are high specificity, compatibility with different types of clinical samples (fresh, frozen, FTA cards, and paraffin-embedded), production of nearly complete infection profiles (viruses, bacteria, fungus, and parasites), production of \"semi-quantitative\" information, direct agent genotyping, and infectious agent mutational information. The achievements of NGS in terms of diagnosing poultry problems are described here, along with future applications. Multiplexing, development of standard operating procedures, robotics, sequencing kits, automated bioinformatics, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence (AI) are disciplines converging toward the use of this technology for active surveillance in poultry farms.

The device shows a lower switching voltage below 0.6 V, with a high ON/OFF current ratio of 104, good stability of more than 180 cycles, and a long retention time exceeding 3 x 103 s. In addition, the device has successfully simulated various biological synaptic functions, including potential/depression propagation, paired-pulse facilitation (PPF), and long-term potentiation/long-term depression (LTP/LTD) modulation. These results have significant implications for the design of a two-dimensional transition-metal dichalcogenides composite material memristor that aim to mimic biological synapses, representing promising avenues for the development of advanced neuromorphic computing systems.",

The new methodology explores the virtual chemical-factorial combination of different commercial drugs (immunosuppressant, antibiotic, antiemetic, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer) with the anticancer drug cytarabine. Real chemical combinations were designed and synthesised for 8-duples, obtaining a small representative library of interesting organic molecules to be biologically tested as proof of concept. The synthesised library contains classical molecular properties regarding the Lipinski rules and/or beyond rules of five (bRo5) and is represented by the covalent combination of the anticancer drug cytarabine with ibuprofen, flurbiprofen, folic acid, sulfasalazine, ciprofloxacin, bortezomib, and methotrexate. The insertion of specific nomenclature could be implemented into artificial intelligence algorithms in order to enhance the efficiency of drug-hunting programs. The novel methodology has proven useful for the straightforward synthesis of most of the theoretically proposed duples and, in principle, could be extended to any other central drug.",

This study addresses the imperative need for early diagnosis of DR and precise treatment strategies based on the explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) framework. The study integrated clinical, biochemical, and metabolomic biomarkers associated with the following classes: non-DR (NDR), non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR), and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) in type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients. To create machine learning (ML) models, 10% of the data was divided into validation sets and 90% into discovery sets. The validation dataset was used for hyperparameter optimization and feature selection stages, while the discovery dataset was used to measure the performance of the models. A 10-fold cross-validation technique was used to evaluate the performance of ML models. Biomarker discovery was performed using minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR), Boruta, and explainable boosting machine (EBM). The predictive proposed framework compares the results of eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), natural gradient boosting for probabilistic prediction (NGBoost), and EBM models in determining the DR subclass. The hyperparameters of the models were optimized using Bayesian optimization. Combining EBM feature selection with XGBoost, the optimal model achieved (91.25 +/- 1.88) % accuracy, (89.33 +/- 1.80) % precision, (91.24 +/- 1.67) % recall, (89.37 +/- 1.52) % F1-Score, and (97.00 +/- 0.25) % the area under the ROC curve (AUROC). According to the EBM explanation, the six most important biomarkers in determining the course of DR were tryptophan (Trp), phosphatidylcholine diacyl C42:2 (PC.aa.C42.2), butyrylcarnitine (C4), tyrosine (Tyr), hexadecanoyl carnitine (C16) and total dimethylarginine (DMA). The identified biomarkers may provide a better understanding of the progression of DR, paving the way for more precise and cost-effective diagnostic and treatment strategies.",

Here, we investigated the contributions of fluid intelligence (Gf) and two executive functions-placekeeping ability and attention control-to the relationship between the Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT) score from the ASVAB and job-relevant multitasking performance. Psychometric network analyses revealed that Gf and placekeeping ability independently contributed to and largely explained the AFQT-multitasking performance relationship. The contribution of attention control to this relationship was negligible. However, attention control did relate positively and significantly to Gf and placekeeping ability, consistent with the hypothesis that it is a cognitive \"primitive\" underlying the individual differences in higher-level cognition. Finally, hierarchical regression analyses revealed stronger evidence for the incremental validity of Gf and placekeeping ability in the prediction of multitasking performance than for the incremental validity of attention control. The results shed light on factors that may underlie the predictive validity of global measures of cognitive ability and suggest how the ASVAB might be augmented to improve its predictive validity.",

The results showed that: (1) as observed among children, adults with SLDs also presented higher scores in the subtests implying reasoning (associated with the General Ability Index, GAI) and lower scores in the subtests involving working memory and processing speed; (2) the discrepancy between full-scale IQ and the GAI had a good predictive value in discriminating adults with and without SLDs; (3) the four-factor hierarchical structure of intelligence proposed for the general adult population held for adults with SLDs as well, even though there were substantial differences in the loadings and a five-factor structure could be more appropriate; (4) similarities as well as strong differences were present between adults and children with SLDs. In adults, scores on subtests were generally lower, particularly in working memory and processing speed. However, in some cases, scores were equal or even higher (as in the \"Similarity\" subtest) among adults, meaning that the discrepancy between the full scale and the GAI was accentuated.",

Moreover, each skill has been theorized to relate to mathematics for different reasons. Thus, it is possible that each cognitive construct is related to mathematics through distinct pathways. The present study tests this hypothesis. One-hundred and eighty 4- to 9-year-olds (M(age) = 6.21) completed a battery of numerical, EF, spatial, and mathematics measures. Factor analyses revealed strong, but separable, relations between children's numerical, EF, and spatial skills. Moreover, the three-factor model (i.e., modelling numerical, EF, and spatial skills as separate latent variables) fit the data better than a general intelligence (g-factor) model. While EF skills were the only unique predictor of number line performance, spatial skills were the only unique predictor of arithmetic (addition) performance. Additionally, spatial skills were related to the use of more advanced addition strategies (e.g., composition/decomposition and retrieval), which in turn were related to children's overall arithmetic performance. That is, children's strategy use fully mediated the relation between spatial skills and arithmetic performance. Taken together, these findings provide new insights into the cognitive foundations of early mathematics, with implications for assessment and instruction moving forward.",

Conventional methods of assessments and diagnosis, often reliant on human expertise, lead to inconsistencies due to professionals' subjectivity, knowledge, and experience. To address these problems head-on, we harnessed artificial intelligence's power to introduce a transformative solution. We leveraged convolutional neural networks to engineer our SCOLIONET architecture, which can accurately identify Cobb angle measurements. Empirical testing on our pipeline demonstrated a mean segmentation accuracy of 97.50% (Sorensen-Dice coefficient) and 96.30% (Intersection over Union), indicating the model's proficiency in outlining vertebrae. The level of quantification accuracy was attributed to the state-of-the-art design of the atrous spatial pyramid pooling to better segment images. We also compared physician's manual evaluations against our machine driven measurements to validate our approach's practicality and reliability further. The results were remarkable, with a p-value (t-test) of 0.1713 and an average acceptable deviation of 2.86 degrees, suggesting insignificant difference between the two methods.

Although the surgical technique has changed in a modern way, the treatment outcome is still influenced by patient age, localization of the bone defect, associated comorbidities, the surgeon approach, and systemic disorders. Three-dimensional magnesium-based scaffolds are considered an important step because they can have precise bone defect geometry, high porosity grade, anatomical pore shape, and mechanical properties close to the human bone. In addition, magnesium has been proven in in vitro and in vivo studies to influence bone regeneration and new blood vessel formation positively. In this review paper, we describe the magnesium alloy's effect on bone regenerative processes, starting with a short description of magnesium's role in the bone healing process, host immune response modulation, and finishing with the primary biological mechanism of magnesium ions in angiogenesis and osteogenesis by presenting a detailed analysis based on a literature review. A strategy that must be followed when a patient-adapted scaffold dedicated to bone tissue engineering is proposed and the main fabrication technologies are combined, in some cases with artificial intelligence for Mg alloy scaffolds, are presented with examples. We emphasized the microstructure, mechanical properties, corrosion behavior, and biocompatibility of each study and made a basis for the researchers who want to start to apply the regenerative potential of magnesium-based scaffolds in clinical practice.

This model engenders the attainment of homogeneous intelligence convergence along the circumferential trajectory. The convergence characteristics are intricately linked to the number of agents and the model parameters. Consequently, we propose positive and negative solutions for ascertaining the convergent circle property and model parameters. Furthermore, by integrating our proposed formation control methodology with a robotic fish dynamics model, we have successfully implemented simulations and experiments, demonstrating the circular formation of multiple biomimetic robotic fish.

Numerous approaches have been employed to study the dynamics of prey-predator interaction systems, with agent-based methodologies gaining popularity. However, existing agent-based models are limited in their ability to handle multi-modal interactions, which are believed to be crucial for understanding living organisms. Conversely, prevailing prey-predator integration studies often rely on mathematical models and computer simulations, neglecting real-world constraints and noise. These elusive attributes, challenging to model, can lead to emergent behaviors and embodied intelligence. To bridge these gaps, our study designs and implements a prey-predator interaction scenario that incorporates visual and olfactory sensory cues not only in computer simulations but also in a real multi-robot system. Observed emergent spatial-temporal dynamics demonstrate successful transitioning of investigating prey-predator interactions from virtual simulations to the tangible world.

Our objective was to analyze all recent trials evaluating these treatments and to compare them in terms of efficacy. We applied the Shiny method, an artificial intelligence technique, to analyze Kaplan-Meier curves and reconstruct patient-level data. Reconstructed patient data were then evaluated through standard survival statistics and subjected to indirect head-to-head treatment comparisons. The endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Based on 432 reconstructed patients, eight trials were analyzed. The survival data from these trials were pooled into three types of treatments: (i) treatments based on tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) combined with reduced-intensity chemotherapy (denoted as TKICHE); (ii) TKIs associated with steroids with no chemotherapy (TKISTE); (iii) chemotherapy-free combinations of blinatumomab plus TKIs (TKIBLI). According to the Shiny method, the three PFS curves were reported in a single Kaplan-Meier graph and subjected to survival statistics. In terms of PFS, TKIBLI ranked first, TKICHE second, and TKISTE third; the differences between these three regimens were statistically significant. This multi-treatment Kaplan-Meier graph, generated through the Shiny method, summarized the current evidence on these treatments in both qualitative and quantitative terms.",

However, its signs on radiographic images can be subtle, which may result in it being overlooked or underdiagnosed. This study aims to utilize artificial intelligence (AI) to create a diagnostic tool for more accurate sacroiliitis detection in radiological images, with the goal of optimizing treatment plans and improving patient outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHOD: The study included 492 patients who visited our hospital. Right sacroiliac joint films were independently evaluated by two musculoskeletal radiologists using the Modified New York criteria (Normal, Grades 1-4). A consensus reading resolved disagreements. The images were preprocessed with Z-score standardization and histogram equalization. The DenseNet121 algorithm, a convolutional neural network with 201 layers, was used for learning and classification. All steps were performed on the DEEP:PHI platform. RESULT: The AI model exhibited high accuracy across different grades: 94.53% (Grade 1), 95.83% (Grade 2), 98.44% (Grade 3), 96.88% (Grade 4), and 96.09% (Normal cases). Sensitivity peaked at Grade 3 and Normal cases (100%), while Grade 4 achieved perfect specificity (100%). PPVs ranged from 82.61% (Grade 1) to 100% (Grade 4), and NPVs peaked at 100% for Grade 3 and Normal cases. The F1 scores ranged from 64.41% (Grade 1) to 95.38% (Grade 3). CONCLUSIONS: The AI diagnostic model showcased a robust performance in detecting and grading sacroiliitis, reflecting its potential to enhance diagnostic accuracy in clinical settings. By facilitating earlier and more accurate diagnoses, this model could substantially impact treatment strategies and patient outcomes.",

In a similar fashion, health care also has a significant environmental impact, and it requires a considerable source of greenhouse gases. Whereas efforts are being made to reduce the footprint of AI tools, here, we were specifically interested in how employing AI tools in gastroenterology departments, and in particular in conjunction with capsule endoscopy, can reduce the carbon footprint associated with digestive health care while offering improvements, particularly in terms of diagnostic accuracy.

Deep learning (DL) has shown potential for improving and standardizing early GC detection. This systematic review aims to evaluate the current status of DL in pre-malignant, early-stage, and gastric neoplasia analysis. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed/MEDLINE for original studies implementing DL algorithms for gastric neoplasia detection using endoscopic images. We adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The focus was on studies providing quantitative diagnostic performance measures and those comparing AI performance with human endoscopists. RESULTS: Our review encompasses 42 studies that utilize a variety of DL techniques. The findings demonstrate the utility of DL in GC classification, detection, tumor invasion depth assessment, cancer margin delineation, lesion segmentation, and detection of early-stage and pre-malignant lesions. Notably, DL models frequently matched or outperformed human endoscopists in diagnostic accuracy. However, heterogeneity in DL algorithms, imaging techniques, and study designs precluded a definitive conclusion about the best algorithmic approach. CONCLUSIONS: The promise of artificial intelligence in improving and standardizing gastric neoplasia detection, diagnosis, and segmentation is significant. This review is limited by predominantly single-center studies and undisclosed datasets used in AI training, impacting generalizability and demographic representation. Further, retrospective algorithm training may not reflect actual clinical performance, and a lack of model details hinders replication efforts. More research is needed to substantiate these findings, including larger-scale multi-center studies, prospective clinical trials, and comprehensive technical reporting of DL algorithms and datasets, particularly regarding the heterogeneity in DL algorithms and study designs.",

Therefore, in this prospective review, we discuss two promising teleneurology approaches and propose adjustments to enhance the value of virtual encounters by improving the validity of neurological examination: 'hybrid teleneurology', which involves revising the workflow of virtual encounters; and 'artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted teleneurology', namely the use of biosensors and wearables and data processing using AI.",

Blood pressure (BP) monitoring is essential for managing the haemodynamic stability of preterm infants and impacts outcomes. However, current methods have many limitations associated, including invasive measurement, inaccuracies, and infection risk. In this narrative review, we find that artificial intelligence (AI) is a promising tool for the continuous measurement of BP in a neonatal cohort, based on data obtained from non-invasive sensors. Our findings highlight key sensing technologies, AI techniques, and model assessment metrics for BP sensing in the neonatal cohort. Moreover, our findings show that non-invasive BP monitoring leveraging AI has shown promise in adult cohorts but has not been broadly explored for neonatal cohorts. We conclude that there is a significant research opportunity in developing an innovative approach to provide a non-invasive alternative to existing continuous BP monitoring methods, which has the potential to improve outcomes for premature babies.",

This device employs a biocompatible chitosan-based hydrogel as an electrolytic gate dielectric. The NW structure, with its high surface-to-volume ratio, facilitated a more effective modulation of the channel conductance induced by protonic-ion polarization. A comparative analysis of the synaptic properties of NW- and film-type devices revealed the distinctive features of the NW-type configuration. In particular, the NW-type synaptic transistors exhibited a significantly larger hysteresis window under identical gate-bias conditions. Notably, these transistors demonstrated enhanced paired-pulse facilitation properties, synaptic weight modulation, and transition from short- to long-term memory. The NW-type devices displayed gradual potentiation and depression of the channel conductance and thus achieved a broader dynamic range, improved linearity, and reduced power consumption compared with their film-type counterparts. Remarkably, the NW-type synaptic transistors exhibited impressive recognition accuracy outcomes in Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology pattern-recognition simulations. This characteristic enhances the efficiency of practical artificial intelligence (AI) processes. Consequently, the proposed NW-type synaptic transistor is expected to emerge as a superior candidate for use in high-efficiency artificial neural network systems, thus making it a promising technology for next-generation AI semiconductor applications.",

            "chunk": "The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increased demand for mental health interventions, with a special focus on digitally assisted ones. Self-regulation describes a set of meta-skills that enable one to take control over his/her mental health and it is recognized as a vital indicator of well-being. Mindfulness training is a promising training strategy for promoting self-regulation, behavioral change, and mental well-being. A growing body of research outlines that smart technologies are ready to revolutionize the way mental health training programs take place. Artificial intelligence (AI); extended reality (XR) including virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR); as well as the advancements in brain computer interfaces (BCIs) are ready to transform these mental health training programs. Mindfulness-based interventions assisted by smart technologies for mental, emotional, and behavioral regulation seem to be a crucial yet under-investigated issue. The current systematic review paper aims to explore whether and how smart technologies can assist mindfulness training for the development of self-regulation skills among people at risk of mental health issues as well as populations with various clinical characteristics. The PRISMA 2020 methodology was utilized to respond to the objectives and research questions using a total of sixty-six experimental studies that met the inclusion criteria. The results showed that digitally assisted mindfulness interventions supported by smart technologies, including AI-based applications, chatbots, virtual coaches, immersive technologies, and brain-sensing headbands, can effectively assist trainees in developing a wide range of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral self-regulation skills, leading to a greater satisfaction of their psychological needs, and thus mental wellness. These results may provide positive feedback for developing smarter and more inclusive training environments, with a special focus on people with special training needs or disabilities.",

This study aimed to validate the Arabic version of the Cognitive Reserve Index Questionnaire (CRIq) in a healthy Lebanese sample. CRIq assesses cognitive reserve through three domains: education, working activity, and leisure time. Statistical measures, including descriptive and regression analysis along with structural equation modeling, were utilized to investigate the convergent and discriminant validity of the CRIq, incorporating fluid intelligence (Gf) and measures of cognitive function, long-term memory encoding and retrieval (Glr), and processing speed (Gs). Results from 174 participants revealed that the activities assessed by the CRIq-Arabic were comparable to the original CRIq study, with slight cultural differences. The internal consistency of the CRIq-Arabic was good (Cronbach's alpha = 0.88), indicating reliability. Convergent validity was confirmed, with moderate to high loadings on the cognitive reserve latent construct. Discriminant validity was supported as correlations between cognitive reserve variables and non-target constructs (Gf, Glr, and Gs) were less than 1. The findings provide an initial psychometric validation of the CRIq-Arabic. Further research of clinical samples is needed to enhance its utility in neuropsychological practice.",

            "chunk": "There is evidence of a relationship between motor and cognitive development. The literature has shown that of all the motor skills, fine motor skills are those that contribute most to mathematical performance in preschool children. As this is a sensitive period in the development of motor skills, low levels of physical activity in this period can compromise their development and contribute to weight gain and obesity. The aim of this study was therefore to analyze the relationship between mathematical and motor skills, physical activity levels, and obesity. The sample consisted of 62 preschool children (32 males) with an average age of 4.63 +/- 0.81. The Weschler preschool and primary scale of intelligence-revised arithmetic test was used to assess mathematical skills. The tests to assess fine motor skills were the \"Adapted Threading Beads Test\" and the \"Adapted Visuomotor Integration Test\". The movement assessment battery for children-2, band 1, \"Aiming & Catching\", and \"Balance\" tests were used to assess gross motor skills. Levels of physical activity were assessed using the \"Preschool-age physical activity questionnaire\" and obesity using the body mass index. The results indicated that only the fine motor skills of visuomotor integration were included in the multiple linear regression model (F < 0.001; r = 0.464; R(2) = 0.215; p < 0.001), with the exclusion of gross motor skills, physical activity levels, and obesity levels. Thus, it was concluded that mathematical skills were only directly and significantly influenced by visuomotor integration. However, visuomotor integration was positively and significantly associated with gross motor skills (r = 0.269; p < 0.05) and not with levels of physical activity and obesity. Thus, gross motor skills could contribute to improving visuomotor integration directly and consequently mathematical skills indirectly. The results of this study suggest that the implementation of structured physical activity programs can contribute to mathematical performance.",

            "chunk": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate sleep disorders and associated factors in patients with rheumatoid-arthritis-associated interstitial lung disease (RA-ILD). METHODS: We performed an observational study of 35 patients with RA-ILD (cases) and 35 age- and sex-matched RA patients without ILD (controls). We evaluated sleep disorders (Oviedo Sleep Questionnaire), positive psychological factors (resilience using the Wagnild and Young Resilience Scale, emotional intelligence using the 24-item Trait Meta-Mood Scale), anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), quality of life (36-item short-form survey), and fatigue (Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Questionnaire). Other variables studied included the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) and RA activity according to the DAS28-ESR. RESULTS: Compared to the controls, the cases were characterized by poorer sleep quality with a higher prevalence of insomnia (42% vs. 20%; p = 0.039), greater severity of insomnia (p = 0.001), and lower sleep satisfaction (p = 0.033). They also had poorer resilience and emotional recovery and more severe anxiety and depression. A diagnosis of ILD was the only factor independently associated with the three dimensions of sleep quality. The predictors of poorer sleep satisfaction in patients with RA-ILD were age (beta = -0.379), DAS28-ESR (beta = -0.331), and usual interstitial pneumonia pattern (beta = -0.438). The predictors of insomnia were DAS28-ESR (beta = 0.294), resilience (beta = -0.352), and CCI (beta = 0.377). CONCLUSIONS: RA-ILD is associated with significant sleep disorders. RA-ILD seems to be an independent risk factor for sleep alterations, with a greater impact on insomnia. Age, disease activity, and comorbidity also play a role in sleep disorders in patients with RA-ILD.",

This study aimed to evaluate a Chat GPT generated patient information leaflet (PIL) against a surgeon generated version, in order to explore a potential application of this artificial intelligence language processing model. METHODS: Cross-sectional study, undertaken May to June 2023, asking two cohorts (patients and doctors) to complete a questionnaire evaluating a Chat GPT generated PIL and a surgeon generated PIL about laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The patients were having laparoscopic cholecystectomy at large private Hospital in Melbourne, Australia, and doctors were recruited from this hospital and a public quaternary hospital in Melbourne, Australia. The study included a convenience sample of 28 patients and 16 doctors. The main outcome measure was a questionnaire (maximum score out of 8) based on validated evaluation instrument for PILs. RESULTS: The study recruited 28 patients and 15 doctors to complete the questionnaire. The Chat GPT and surgeon generated PILs were scored similarly by patients (median 8 for both PIL; mean 7.5 for Chat GPT PIL vs. 7.1 for surgeon PIL). Doctors also scored both versions similarly, with slightly higher scores for Chat GPT over surgeon version (median 7 vs. 6; mean 6.7 vs. 5.6, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The Chat GPT generated PIL was assessed as being as good or slightly better than the surgeon generated version. This study shows that PIL are a feasible application of AI language processing models.",

In recent years, many artificial intelligence applications have been used in the field of gastric cancer through their effective computing and learning ability. In this study, we aim to develop a software that can accurately detect overall survival in gastric cancer cases with the help of artificial intelligence and machine learning. METHODS: The study included 34417 patients' data diagnosed with gastric cancer between 2010 and 2015. The main hypothesis in the study was overall survival (OS) in years, defined from the date of diagnosis to the date of death or, for living patients, the last control date. In addition to survival, other variables selected for the analyzes were age at diagnosis, race, gender, behavior, primary site, grade, histology, T stage, N stage, M stage and size of the tumor, vital status, and follow-up time (months). RESULTS: The median overall survival of the patients was found to be 15.00+/-0.20 years. Median life expectancy was found to be 21.00+/-0.85 years for those younger than 50 years of age, 20.00+/-0.43 years for those aged 50-69 years, and 10.00+/-0.22 years for those aged 70 and over. Especially artificial intelligence techniques such as machine learning and deep learning lead to remarkable developments in the field of gastric cancer. CONCLUSION: With the ability to compute and learn we think that use of artificial intelligence will be revolutionary in gastric cancer in terms of diagnosis and prognosis.

We found that both SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity were associated with negative impacts on patients' health. Furthermore, we observed a negative association between COVID-19 severity and cognitive performance. Younger participants had a higher likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 contraction, while the elderly had a higher likelihood of severe COVID-19 and vaccination. The association between age and COVID-19 severity was primarily mediated by older participants' impaired long-term health.

AI in healthcare uses machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing to analyze copious amounts of healthcare data and yield valuable outcomes. In the sleep medicine field, a large amount of physiological data is gathered compared to other branches of medicine. This field is primed for innovations with the help of AI. A good quality of sleep is crucial for optimal health. About one billion people are estimated to have obstructive sleep apnea worldwide, but it is difficult to diagnose and treat all the people with limited resources. Sleep apnea is one of the major contributors to poor health. Most of the sleep apnea patients remain undiagnosed. Those diagnosed with sleep apnea have difficulty getting it optimally treated due to several factors, and AI can help in this situation. AI can also help in the diagnosis and management of other sleep disorders such as insomnia, hypersomnia, parasomnia, narcolepsy, shift work sleep disorders, periodic leg movement disorders, etc. In this manuscript, we aim to address three critical issues about the use of AI in sleep medicine: (1) How can AI help in diagnosing and treating sleep disorders? (2) How can AI fill the gap in the care of sleep disorders? and (3) What are the ethical and legal considerations of using AI in sleep medicine?",

            "chunk": "BACKGROUND: ChatGPT (OpenAI Incorporated, Mission District, San Francisco, United States) is an artificial intelligence (AI)-based language model that generates human-resembling texts. This AI-generated literary work is comprehensible and contextually relevant and it is really difficult to differentiate from human-written content. ChatGPT has risen in popularity lately and is widely utilized in scholarly manuscript drafting. The aim of this study is to identify if 1) human reviewers can differentiate between AI-generated and human-written abstracts and 2) AI detectors are currently reliable in detecting AI-generated abstracts. METHODS: Seven blinded reviewers were asked to read 21 abstracts and differentiate which were AI-generated and which were human-written. The first group consisted of three orthopaedic residents with limited research experience (OR). The second group included three orthopaedic professors with extensive research experience (OP). The seventh reviewer was a non-orthopaedic doctor and acted as a control in terms of expertise. All abstracts were scanned by a plagiarism detector program. The performance of detecting AI-generated abstracts of two different AI detectors was also analyzed. A structured interview was conducted at the end of the survey in order to evaluate the decision-making process utilized by each reviewer. RESULTS: The OR group managed to identify correctly 34.9% of the abstracts' authorship and the OP group 31.7%. The non-orthopaedic control identified correctly 76.2%. All AI-generated abstracts were 100% unique (0% plagiarism). The first AI detector managed to identify correctly only 9/21 (42.9%) of the abstracts' authors, whereas the second AI detector identified 14/21 (66.6%). CONCLUSION: Inability to correctly identify AI-generated context poses a significant scientific risk as \"false\" abstracts can end up in scientific conferences or publications. Neither expertise nor research background was shown to have any meaningful impact on the predictive outcome. Focus on statistical data presentation may help the differentiation process. Further research is warranted in order to highlight which elements could help reveal an AI-generated abstract.",

            "chunk": "OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to investigate otolaryngologists' knowledge, trust, acceptance, and concerns with clinical applications of artificial intelligence (AI). METHODS: This study used mixed methods with survey and semistructured interviews. Survey was e-mailed to American Rhinologic Society members, of which a volunteer sample of 86 members responded. Nineteen otolaryngologists were purposefully recruited and interviewed until thematic saturation was achieved. RESULTS: Seventy-six respondents (10% response rate) completed the majority of the survey: 49% worked in academic settings and 43% completed residency 10 or fewer years ago. Of 19 interviewees, 58% worked in academic settings, and 47% completed residency 10 or fewer years ago. Familiarity: Only 8% of survey respondents reported having AI training in residency, although 72% had familiarity with general AI concepts; 0 interviewees had personal experience with AI in clinical settings. Expected uses: Of the surveyed otolaryngologists, 82% would use an AI-based clinical decision aid and 74% were comfortable with AI proposing treatment recommendations. However, only 44% of participants would trust AI to identify malignancy and 53% to interpret radiographic images. Interviewees trusted AI for simple tasks, such as labeling septal deviation, more than complex ones, such as identifying tumors. Factors influencing AI adoption: 89% of survey participants would use AI if it improved patient satisfaction, 78% would be willing to use AI if experts and studies validated the technologies, and 73% would only use AI if it increased efficiency. Sixty-one percent of survey respondents expected AI incorporation into clinical practice within 5 years. Interviewees emphasized that AI adoption depends on its similarity to their clinical judgment and to expert opinion. Concerns included nuanced or complex cases, poor design or accuracy, and the personal nature of physician-patient relationships. CONCLUSION: Few physicians have experience with AI technologies but expect rapid adoption in the clinic, highlighting the urgent need for clinical education and research. Otolaryngologists are most receptive to AI \"augmenting\" physician expertise and administrative capacity, with respect for physician autonomy and maintaining relationships with patients. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level VI, descriptive or qualitative study.",

The VS is traditionally classified into ligand-based (LB) and structure-based (SB) approaches. Machine intelligence or artificial intelligence has wide applications in the drug discovery domain to reduce time and resource consumption. In combination with machine intelligence algorithms, VS has emerged into revolutionarily progressive technology that learns within robust decision orders for data curation and hit molecule screening from large VS libraries in minutes or hours. The exponential growth of chemical and biological data has evolved as \"big-data\" in the public domain demands modern and advanced machine intelligence-driven VS approaches to screen hit molecules from ultra-large VS libraries. VS has evolved from an individual approach (LB and SB) to integrated LB and SB techniques to explore various ligand and target protein aspects for the enhanced rate of appropriate hit molecule prediction. Current trends demand advanced and intelligent solutions to handle enormous data in drug discovery domain for screening and optimizing hits or lead with fewer or no false positive hits. Following the big-data drift and tremendous growth in computational architecture, we presented this review.

METHODS: The highlights of the sessions on BIG DATA, genetics, modifiable lifestyle risk factors, female sex hormones, and neuroprotection in the field of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) were summarized. RESULTS: The researchers discussed the importance of BIG DATA repositories available at national and international levels for POAG research, including the United Kingdom Biobank. Combining genotyped large cohorts worldwide, facilitated by artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning approaches, led to the milestone discovery of 312 genome-wide significant disease loci for POAG. While these loci could be combined into a polygenic risk score with clinical utility, Think Tank meeting participants also provided analytical epidemiological evidence that behavioral risk factors modify POAG polygenetic risk, citing specific examples related to caffeine and alcohol use. The impact of female sex hormones on POAG pathophysiology was discussed, as was neuroprotection and the potential use of AI to help mitigate specific challenges faced in clinical trials and speed approval of neuroprotective agents. CONCLUSION: The experts agreed on the importance of genetics in defining individual POAG risk and highlighted the additional crucial role of lifestyle, gender, blood pressure, and vascular risk factors. The main takeaways also included that BIG DATA repositories and AI are important combinatory tools to foster novel strategies to prevent and stabilize glaucoma and, in the future, recover vision loss from the disease.",

To gain a comprehensive understanding of thyroid cancer at the single-cell level, this narrative review evaluates the applications of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) in thyroid cancer research. ScRNA-seq has revolutionised the identification and characterisation of distinct cell subpopulations, cell-to-cell communications, and receptor interactions, revealing unprecedented heterogeneity and shedding light on novel biomarkers for therapeutic discovery. These findings aid in the construction of predictive models on disease prognosis and therapeutic efficacy. Altogether, scRNA-seq has deepened our understanding of the tumour microenvironment immunologic insights, informing future studies in the development of effective personalised treatment for patients. Challenges and limitations of scRNA-seq, such as technical biases, financial barriers, and ethical concerns, are discussed. Advancements in computational methods, the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL), and the importance of single-cell data sharing and collaborative efforts are highlighted. Future directions of scRNA-seq in thyroid cancer research include investigating intra-tumoral heterogeneity, integrating with other omics technologies, exploring the non-coding RNA landscape, and studying rare subtypes. Overall, scRNA-seq has transformed thyroid cancer research and holds immense potential for advancing personalised therapies and improving patient outcomes. Efforts to make this technology more accessible and cost-effective will be crucial to ensuring its widespread utilisation in healthcare.",

DESIGN: In the evaluation of the responses provided by the OpenAI ChatGPT to the CLP-related 50 questions, several tools were utilized, including the Ensuring Quality Information for Patients (EQIP) tool, Reliability Scoring System (Adapted from DISCERN), Flesh Reading Ease Formula (FRES) and Flesch-Kinkaid Reading Grade Level (FKRGL) formulas, Global Quality Scale (GQS), and Similarity Index with plagiarism-detection tool. Jamovi (The Jamovi Project, 2022, version 2.3; Sydney, Australia) software was used for all statistical analyses. RESULTS: Based on the reliability and GQS values, ChatGPT demonstrated high reliability and good quality attributable to CLP. Furthermore, according to the FRES results, ChatGPT's readability is difficult, and the similarity index values of this software exhibit an acceptable level of similarity ratio. There is no significant difference in EQIP, Reliability Score System, FRES, FKGRL, GQS, and Similarity Index values among the two categories. CONCLUSION: OpenAI ChatGPT provides a highly reliable, high-quality, but challenging to read, and acceptable similarity rate in providing information related to CLP.

            "chunk": "While duration of the psychosis prodrome (DPP) attracts attention in relation to the developmental trajectory of psychotic illness and service models, fundamental issues endure in the context of dimensional-spectrum models of psychosis. Among 205 epidemiologically representative subjects in the Cavan-Monaghan First Episode Psychosis Study, DPP was systematically quantified and compared, for the first time, across all 12 DSM-IV psychotic diagnoses. DPP was also compared with duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) and each was then analysed in relation to premorbid features across three age ranges: <12, 12-15 and 16-18 years. For each diagnosis, medians for both DPP and DUP were shorter than means, indicating common right-skewed distributions. Rank orders for both DPP and DUP were longest for schizophrenia, intermediate for other schizophrenia-spectrum psychoses, psychotic depression and psychotic disorder not otherwise specified, and shortest for brief psychotic disorder, bipolar disorder and substance-induced psychotic disorder, though with overlapping right-skewed distributions. DPP was longer than DUP for all diagnoses except substance-induced psychotic disorder. Across functional psychotic diagnoses, longer DPP was predicted by higher premorbid intelligence and better premorbid adjustment during age 16-18 years. These findings indicate that, trans-diagnostically, DPP and DUP share right-skewed continuities, in accordance with a dimensional-spectrum model of psychotic illness, and may reflect a unitary process that has been dichotomized at a subjective threshold along its trajectory. Better premorbid functioning during age 16-18 years appears to confer resilience by delaying progression to overt psychotic symptoms and may constitute a particular target period for psychosocial interventions.",

            "chunk": "BACKGROUND: Malaria continues to pose a significant burden in endemic countries, many of which lack access to molecular surveillance. Insights from malaria cases in travellers returning to non-endemic areas can provide valuable data to inform endemic country programs. To evaluate the potential for novel global insights into malaria, we examined epidemiological and molecular data from imported malaria cases to Australia. METHODS: We analysed malaria cases reported in Australia from 2012 to 2022 using National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (NNDSS) data. Molecular data on imported malaria cases were obtained from literature searches. RESULTS: Between 2012 and 2022, 3204 malaria cases were reported in Australia. Most cases (69%) were male and 44% occurred in young adults aged 20-39 years. Incidence rates initially declined between 2012 and 2015, then increased until 2019. During 2012-2019, the incidence in travellers ranged from 1.34 to 7.71 per 100 000 trips. Cases were primarily acquired in Sub-Saharan Africa (n = 1433; 45%), Oceania (n = 569; 18%) and Southern and Central Asia (n = 367; 12%). The most common countries of acquisition were Papua New Guinea (n = 474) and India (n = 277). P. falciparum accounted for 58% (1871/3204) of cases and was predominantly acquired in Sub-Saharan Africa, and P. vivax accounted for 32% (1016/3204), predominantly from Oceania and Asia. Molecular studies of imported malaria cases to Australia identified genetic mutations and deletions associated with drug resistance and false-negative rapid diagnostic test results, and led to the establishment of reference genomes for P. vivax and P. malariae. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis highlights the continuing burden of imported malaria into Australia. Molecular studies have offered valuable insights into drug resistance and diagnostic limitations, and established reference genomes. Integrating molecular data into national surveillance systems could provide important infectious disease intelligence to optimise treatment guidelines for returning travellers and support endemic country surveillance programs.",

Indeed, these models have demonstrated remarkable prowess in generating humanlike text, evidenced by a growing body of research and real-world applications. This capability paves the way for enhanced patient engagement, clinical decision support, and a plethora of other applications that were once considered beyond reach. However, the journey from potential to real-world application is laden with challenges ranging from ensuring reliability and transparency to navigating a complex regulatory landscape. There is still a need for comprehensive evaluation and rigorous validation to ensure that these models are reliable, transparent, and ethically sound. This editorial introduces the new section, titled \"AI Language Models in Health Care.\" This section seeks to create a platform for academics, practitioners, and innovators to share their insights, research findings, and real-world applications of AI language models in health care. The aim is to foster a community that is not only excited about the possibilities but also critically engaged with the ethical, practical, and regulatory challenges that lie ahead.",

Moreover, the healing of the wound in the sub-acute care setting requires continuous tracking to avoid complications. Artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision (CV) provide a unique opportunity to build low-cost and accessible tools to classify burn severity and track changes of wound parameters, both in the clinic by physicians and nurses, and asynchronously in the remote setting by the patient themselves. Wound assessments can be achieved by AI-CV using the principles of Image-Guided Therapy (IGT) using high-quality 2D colour images. Wound parameters can include wound 2D spatial dimension and the characterization of wound colour changes which demonstrates physiological changes such as presentation of eschar/necrotic tissue, pustulence, granulation tissue and scabbing. Here we present the development of AI-CV-based Skin Abnormality Tracking Algorithm (SATA) pipeline. Additionally, we provide the results on a single localized burn tracked for a 6-week period in clinic, and an additional 2-week period of home monitoring.",

STUDY DESIGN: Cross-Sectional Survey Study. SETTING: Single institution tertiary care center. METHODS: ChatGPT was used to generate presurgical educational information including indications, risks, and recovery time for five common head and neck surgeries. Chatbot-generated information was compared with information gathered from a simple browser search (first publicly available website excluding scholarly articles). The accuracy of the information, readability, thoroughness, and number of errors were compared by five experienced head and neck surgeons in a blinded fashion. Each surgeon then chose a preference between the two information sources for each surgery. RESULTS: With the exception of total word count, ChatGPT-generated pre-surgical information has similar readability, content of knowledge, accuracy, thoroughness, and numbers of medical errors when compared to publicly available websites. Additionally, ChatGPT was preferred 48% of the time by experienced head and neck surgeons. CONCLUSION: Head and neck surgeons rated ChatGPT-generated and readily available online educational materials similarly. Further refinement in AI technology may soon open more avenues for patient counseling. Future investigations into the medical safety of AI counseling and exploring patients' perspectives would be of strong interest. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: N/A. Laryngoscope, 2023.",

DATA SOURCE: A systematic review was conducted in PubMed/MEDLINE, Virtual Health Library, and Cochrane Library databases. Studies that addressed the use of early stimulation in playful and interactive environments in children with microcephaly were included. There were no restrictions on the publication date or language of the studies. The outcomes assessed were muscle tone, social interaction, fine and gross motor skills, intelligence quotient, socioemotional and adaptive behavior of the child. The methodological quality and the scientific evidence level were assessed using the Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies of Interventions, the Revised Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomized trials and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation. DATA SYNTHESIS: 264 articles were identified, but only 7 met the eligibility criteria. The included studies had a total population of 125 individuals, with sample sizes ranging from 1 to 71 participants. CONCLUSIONS: The studies showed low evidence of an effect of early intervention on the outcomes muscle tone, social interaction, fine and gross motor skills, intelligence quotient, and socioemotional and adaptive behavior in children with microcephaly.

It has been suggested that the anticonvulsant-exposed child with these subtle changes in facial features (the \"anticonvulsant face\") has a greater likelihood of having deficits in IQ in comparison with children exposed to the same anticonvulsants who do not have these features. 115 AED-exposed children (40, PHT; 34, PB; and 41, CBZ) between 6.5 and 16 years of age and 111 unexposed children matched by sex, race, and year in school were evaluated. The evaluations were (WISC-III), physical examination with measurements of facial features and digits and photographs. The AED-exposed children had cephalometric radiographs, but not the unexposed. Each parent had a similar examination of face and hands plus tests of intelligence. These AED-exposed children showed an increased frequency of a short nose and anteverted nares, features of the \"anticonvulsant face.\" Lateral skull radiographs showed a decrease in the angle between the anterior cranial base and nasal bone, which produces anteverted nares. Mean IQs were significantly lower on one or more IQ measures for the children with these facial features. Shortening of the distal phalanges and small fingernails correlated with the presence of a short nose in that child. The findings in 115 children exposed at conception to either phenytoin, phenobarbital, or carbamazepine, as monotherapy, confirmed the hypothesis that those with a short nose and anteverted nares had a lower IQ than exposed children without those features.",

Specifically, we discuss the use of small molecules to interfere with TF function and the development of transcription factor decoys, oligonucleotides that compete with promoters for TF binding. We also cover peptides that target the interaction between the bacterial TF and other factors, such as RNA polymerase, and the targeting of sigma factors. These strategies, while promising, come with challenges, from identifying targets to designing interventions, managing side effects, and accounting for changing bacterial resistance patterns. We also delve into how Artificial Intelligence contributes to these efforts and how it may be exploited in the future, and we touch on the roles of multidisciplinary collaboration and policy to advance this research domain.Abbreviations: AI, artificial intelligence; CNN, convolutional neural networks; DTI: drug-target interaction; HTH, helix-turn-helix; IHF, integration host factor; LTTRs, LysR-type transcriptional regulators; MarR, multiple antibiotic resistance regulator; MRSA, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus; MSA: multiple sequence alignment; NAP, nucleoid-associated protein; PROTACs, proteolysis targeting chimeras; RNAP, RNA polymerase; TF, transcription factor; TFD, transcription factor decoying; TFTRs, TetR-family transcriptional regulators; wHTH, winged helix-turn-helix.",

Notwithstanding the practical significance, however, scholarly attention is far from adequate especially in the context of African higher education. Thus, taking Ethiopia as an example, this study investigates (a) gender differences in EI and (b) the relationship between EI and leadership style among leaders in selected higher education institutions. The study was conducted on 210 random samples of academic leaders (135 men and 75 women). Data was generated using an adapted measure Emotional and Social Competence Inventory (ESCI) to assess leaders' emotional intelligence (EI), while the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ-5x) was used to measure leadership styles. The findings show a strong positive relationship between emotional intelligence and transformational leadership, but no relationship was found between EI and transactional leadership. On the other hand, a significant negative correlation was found between laissez-faire leadership and leaders' total EI scores. Furthermore, the study finds significant gender differences in emotional intelligence, with female leaders scoring higher in overall emotional intelligence and most of the EI components. These findings suggest that EI is the female leadership advantage. We strongly advise university administrators and policymakers to incorporate EI as a criterion for the recruitment, selection, and promotion of academic leaders to close the gender gap in higher education leadership.",

New developments in fields like communication technology and the UAV needs to be able to act autonomously by gathering data and then making choices. These tendencies have brought us to cutting-edge levels of health care, transportation, energy, monitoring, and security for visual image detection and manufacturing endeavors. These include coordination in communication via IoT, sustainability of IoT network, and optimization challenges in path planning. Because of their limited battery life, these gadgets are limited in their range of communication. UAVs can be seen as terminal devices connected to a large network where a swarm of other UAVs is coordinating their motions, directing one another, and maintaining watch over locations outside its visual range. One of the essential components of UAV-based applications is the ability to recognize objects of interest in aerial photographs taken by UAVs. While aerial photos might be useful, object detection is challenging. As a result, capturing aerial photographs with UAVs is a unique challenge since the size of things in these images might vary greatly. The study proposal included specific information regarding the Detection of Visual Images by UAVs (DVI-UAV) using the IoT and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Included in the study of AI is the concept of DSYolov3. The DSYolov3 model was presented to deal with these problems in the UAV industry. By fusing the channel-wise feature across multiple scales using a spatial pyramid pooling approach, the proposed study creates a novel module, Multi-scale Fusion of Channel Attention (MFCAM), for scale-variant object identification tasks. The method's effectiveness and efficiency have been thoroughly tested and evaluated experimentally. The suggested method would allow us to outperform most current detectors and guarantee that the models will be useable on UAVs. There will be a 95 % success rate in terms of visual image detection, a 94 % success rate in terms of computation cost, a 97 % success rate in terms of accuracy, and a 95 % success rate in terms of effectiveness.",

            "chunk": "The Internet of Things (IoT), big data, and artificial intelligence (AI) are all key technologies that influence the formation and implementation of digital medical services. Building Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) systems that combine advanced sensors with AI-powered insights is critical for intelligent medical systems. This paper presents an IoMT framework for brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analysis to lessen the unavoidable diagnosis and therapy faults that occur in human clinical settings for the accurate detection of cerebral microbleeds (CMBs). The problems in accurate CMB detection include that CMBs are tiny dots 5-10 mm in diameter; they are similar to healthy tissues and are exceedingly difficult to identify, necessitating specialist guidance in remote and underdeveloped medical centers. Secondly, in the existing studies, computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) systems are designed for accurate CMB detection, however, their proposed approaches consist of two stages. Potential candidate CMBs from the complete MRI image are selected in the first stage and then passed to the phase of false-positive reduction. These pre-and post-processing steps make it difficult to build a completely automated CAD system for CMB that can produce results without human intervention. Hence, as a key goal of this work, an end-to-end enhanced UNet-based model for effective CMB detection and segmentation for IoMT devices is proposed. The proposed system requires no pre-processing or post-processing steps for CMB segmentation, and no existing research localizes each CMB pixel from the complete MRI image input. The findings indicate that the suggested method outperforms in detecting CMBs in the presence of contrast variations and similarities with other normal tissues and yields a good dice score of 0.70, an accuracy of 99 %, as well as a false-positive rate of 0.002 %.

Sustainable agri-food production technologies have been reliable in mitigating poverty caused by high demands for food. Recently, the applications of agri-food system technologies have been meaningfully changing the worldwide scene due to both external strengths and internal forces. Digital agriculture (DA) is a pioneering technology helping to meet the growing global demand for sustainable food production. Integrating different sub-branches of DA technologies such as artificial intelligence, automation and robotics, sensors, Internet of Things (IoT) and data analytics into agriculture practices to reduce waste, optimize farming inputs and enhance crop production. This can help shift from tedious operations to continuously automated processes, resulting in increasing agricultural production by enabling the traceability of products and processes. The application of DA provides agri-food producers with accurate and real-time observations regarding different features influencing their productivity, such as plant health, soil quality, weather conditions, and pest and disease pressure. Analyzing the results achieved by DA can help agricultural producers and scholars make better decisions to increase yields, improve efficiency, reduce costs, and manage resources. The core focus of the current work is to clarify the benefits of some sub-branches of DA in increasing agricultural production efficiency, discuss the challenges of practical DA in the field, and highlight the future perspectives of DA. This review paper can open new directions to speed up the DA application on the farm and link traditional agriculture with modern farming technologies.",

            "chunk": "BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) has been the subject of studies in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and may affect its identification, diagnosis, intervention, and other medical practices in the future. Although previous studies have used bibliometric techniques to analyze and investigate AI, there has been little research on the adoption of AI in ASD. This study aimed to explore the broad applications and research frontiers of AI used in ASD. METHODS: Citation data were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database to assess the extent to which AI is used in ASD. CiteSpace.5.8. R3 and VOSviewer, two online tools for literature metrology analysis, were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: A total of 776 publications from 291 countries and regions were analyzed; of these, 256 publications were from the United States and 173 publications were from China, and England had the largest centrality of 0.33; Stanford University had the highest H-index of 17; and the largest cluster label of co-cited references was machine learning. In addition, keywords with a high number of occurrences in this field were autism spectrum disorder (295), children (255), classification (156) and diagnosis (77). The burst keywords from 2021 to 2023 were infants and feature selection, and from 2022 to 2023, the burst keyword was corpus callosum. CONCLUSION: This research provides a systematic analysis of the literature concerning AI used in ASD, presenting an overall demonstration in this field. In this area, the United States and China have the largest number of publications, England has the greatest influence, and Stanford University is the most influential. In addition, the research on AI used in ASD mostly focuses on classification and diagnosis, and \"infants, feature selection, and corpus callosum are at the forefront, providing directions for future research. However, the use of AI technologies to identify ASD will require further research.",

The present study was conducted to analyze and compare the accuracy of three deep learning neural networks for oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) images. Materials and methods Three hundred and twenty-five cases of OSCC were included and graded histologically by two grading systems. The images were then analyzed using the Orange data mining tool. Three neural networks, viz., InceptionV3, SqueezeNet, and VGG16, were used for further analysis and classification. Positive predictive value, negative predictive value, specificity, sensitivity, area under curve (AUC), and accuracy were estimated for each neural network. Results Histological grading by Bryne's yielded significantly stronger inter-observer agreement. The highest accuracy was found for the classification of poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma images irrespective of the network used. Other values were variegated. Conclusion AI could serve as an adjunct for improvement in theragnostics. Further research is required to achieve the modification of mining tools for greater predictive values, sensitivity, specificity, AUC, accuracy, and security.

Due to saliency in brain cognition, we construct a new spatio-temporal convolutional attention network for emotion recognition named BiTCAN. First, in the proposed method, the original EEG signals are de-baselined, and the two-dimensional mapping matrix sequence of EEG signals is constructed by combining the electrode position. Second, on the basis of the two-dimensional mapping matrix sequence, the features of saliency in brain cognition are extracted by using the Bi-hemisphere discrepancy module, and the spatio-temporal features of EEG signals are captured by using the 3-D convolution module. Finally, the saliency features and spatio-temporal features are fused into the attention module to further obtain the internal spatial relationships between brain regions, and which are input into the classifier for emotion recognition. Many experiments on DEAP and SEED (two public datasets) show that the accuracies of the proposed algorithm on both are higher than 97%, which is superior to most existing emotion recognition algorithms.",

Web of Science was used to retrieve publications on the application of AI in RA from 2003 to 2022. Bibliometric analysis and visualization were performed using Microsoft Excel (2019), R software (4.2.2) and VOSviewer (1.6.18). The overall distribution of yearly outputs, leading countries, top institutions and authors, active journals, co-cited references and keywords were analyzed. A total of 859 relevant articles were identified in the Web of Science with an increasing trend. USA and China were the leading countries in this field, accounting for 71.59% of publications in total. Harvard University was the most influential institution. Arthritis Research & Therapy was the most active journal. Primary topics in this field focused on estimating the risk of developing RA, diagnosing RA using sensor, clinical, imaging and omics data, identifying the phenotype of RA patients using electronic health records, predicting treatment response, tracking the progression of the disease and predicting prognosis and developing new drugs. Machine learning and deep learning algorithms were the recent research hotspots and trends in this field. AI has potential applications in various fields of RA, including the risk assessment, screening, early diagnosis, monitoring, prognosis determination, achieving optimal therapeutic outcomes and new drug development for RA patients.

METHODS: Four neuroanesthesiologists independently assessed whether ChatGPT could apply 52 high-quality recommendations (HQRs) included in the 3 SNACC guidelines. HQRs were deemed present in the ChatGPT responses if noted by at least 3 of the 4 reviewers. Reviewers also identified incorrect references, potentially harmful recommendations, and whether ChatGPT cited the SNACC guidelines. RESULTS: The overall reviewer agreement for the presence of HQRs in the ChatGPT answers ranged from 0% to 100%. Only 4 of 52 (8%) HQRs were deemed present by at least 3 of the 4 reviewers after 5 generic questions, and 23 (44%) HQRs were deemed present after at least 1 additional targeted question. Potentially harmful recommendations were identified for each of the 3 clinical scenarios and ChatGPT failed to cite the SNACC guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: The ChatGPT answers were open to human interpretation regarding whether the responses included the HQRs. Though targeted questions resulted in the inclusion of more HQRs than generic questions, fewer than 50% of HQRs were noted even after targeted questions. This suggests that ChatGPT should not currently be considered a reliable source of information for clinical decision-making. Future iterations of ChatGPT may refine algorithms to improve its reliability as a source of clinical information.",

We held four meetings of older people, clinicians and AI researchers. Three priority areas were identified for AI application in the care of older people. These included: monitoring and early diagnosis of disease, stratified care and care coordination between healthcare providers. However, the meetings also highlighted concerns that AI may exacerbate health inequity for older people through bias within AI models, lack of external validation amongst older people, infringements on privacy and autonomy, insufficient transparency of AI models and lack of safeguarding for errors. Creating effective interventions for older people requires a person-centred approach to account for the needs of older people, as well as sufficient clinical and technological governance to meet standards of generalisability, transparency and effectiveness.

Screening mammograms were processed by a commercial AI system and detection accuracy was evaluated in two scenarios, Standalone AI and AI-integrated screening replacing first reader, with first reader and double reading with arbitration (combined reading) as comparators, respectively. Two AI-score cut-off points were applied by matching at mean first reader sensitivity (AI(sens)) and specificity (AI(spec)). Reference standard was histopathology-proven breast cancer or cancer-free follow-up within 24 months. Coprimary endpoints were sensitivity and specificity, and secondary endpoints were positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), recall rate, and arbitration rate. Accuracy estimates were calculated using McNemar's test or exact binomial test. RESULTS: Out of 272,008 screening mammograms from 158,732 women, 257,671 (94.7%) with adequate image data were included in the final analyses. Sensitivity and specificity were 63.7% (95% CI 61.6%-65.8%) and 97.8% (97.7-97.8%) for first reader, and 73.9% (72.0-75.8%) and 97.9% (97.9-98.0%) for combined reading, respectively. Standalone AI(sens) showed a lower specificity (-1.3%) and PPV (-6.1%), and a higher recall rate (+ 1.3%) compared to first reader (p < 0.0001 for all), while Standalone AI(spec) had a lower sensitivity (-5.1%; p < 0.0001), PPV (-1.3%; p = 0.01) and NPV (-0.04%; p = 0.0002). Compared to combined reading, Integrated AI(sens) achieved higher sensitivity (+ 2.3%; p = 0.0004), but lower specificity (-0.6%) and PPV (-3.9%) as well as higher recall rate (+ 0.6%) and arbitration rate (+ 2.2%; p < 0.0001 for all). Integrated AI(spec) showed no significant difference in any outcome measures apart from a slightly higher arbitration rate (p < 0.0001). Subgroup analyses showed higher detection of interval cancers by Standalone AI and Integrated AI at both thresholds (p < 0.0001 for all) with a varying composition of detected cancers across multiple subgroups of tumour characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: Replacing first reader in double reading with an AI could be feasible but choosing an appropriate AI threshold is crucial to maintaining cancer detection accuracy and workload.",

In this perspective, we distill key parts of this discussion, including understanding why this topic is important to neuroradiologists and lending insight on how neuroradiologists can develop a framework to assess health equity-related bias in artificial intelligence tools. In addition, we provide examples of clinical workflow implementation of these tools so that we can begin to see how artificial intelligence tools will impact discourse on equitable radiologic care.

Besides, it can also be used to screen for bone health using the digital radiogrammetry tool called bone health index (BHI) for which normative reference values available are calculated from healthy European children. Due to ethnic difference in bone geometry, in a previous study, we generated reference curves based on healthy Indian children. The objectives of this study were: 1) To assess and compare bone health of Indian children with Type 1 diabetes (T1D) using both European and Indian BHI SDS reference data and 2) To identify determinants of poor bone health in Indian children and youth with T1D by using BHI tool (based on BHI-SDS Indian reference data) of BX. METHOD: The BHI was assessed retrospectively in 1159 subjects with T1D using digitalised left-hand x-rays and SDS were computed using European and Indian data. The demographic, anthropometric, clinical, biochemistry, dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) data and peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) data collection were performed using standard protocols and were extracted from hospital records. RESULTS: The BHI correlated well with DXA and pQCT parameters in subjects with T1D. BHI-SDS calculated using Indian reference data had better correlation with height and DXA parameters. 8.6% study participants had low (less than -2) BHI-SDS (Indian), with height SDS having significant effect. Subjects with low BHI-SDS were older, shorter and had higher duration of diabetes. They also had lower IGF1 and vitamin D concentrations, bone mineral density, and trabecular density. Female gender, increased duration of illness, poor glycaemic control, and vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency were significant predictors of poor BHI-SDS. CONCLUSION: Our study highlights the utility of digital radiogrammetry AI tool to screen for bone health of children with T1D and demonstrates and highlights the necessity of interpretation using ethnicity specific normative data.",

When combined with the exceptionally high electrostatic control in atomically thin materials(5-8), moire heterostructures have the potential to enable next-generation electronic devices with unprecedented functionality. However, despite extensive exploration, moire electronic phenomena have thus far been limited to impractically low cryogenic temperatures(9-14), thus precluding real-world applications of moire quantum materials. Here we report the experimental realization and room-temperature operation of a low-power (20 pW) moire synaptic transistor based on an asymmetric bilayer graphene/hexagonal boron nitride moire heterostructure. The asymmetric moire potential gives rise to robust electronic ratchet states, which enable hysteretic, non-volatile injection of charge carriers that control the conductance of the device. The asymmetric gating in dual-gated moire heterostructures realizes diverse biorealistic neuromorphic functionalities, such as reconfigurable synaptic responses, spatiotemporal-based tempotrons and Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro input-specific adaptation. In this manner, the moire synaptic transistor enables efficient compute-in-memory designs and edge hardware accelerators for artificial intelligence and machine learning.",

An activation log-sigmoid function, twelve numbers of neurons, SCJG optimization, hidden and output layers are presented in this stochastic computing work for solving the learning language model. The correctness of AI based SCJGNN is noted through the overlapping of the results along with the small calculated absolute error that are around 10(-06) to 10(-08) for each class of the model.

The present study was designed to investigate the significance of individual components within the score for PsA activity. A cohort of 80 PsA patients (44 women and 36 men, aged 56.3 +/- 12 years) with a range of disease activity from remission to moderate was analyzed using unsupervised and supervised methods applied to the DAS28-CRP components. Machine learning-based permutation importance identified tenderness in the metacarpophalangeal joint of the right index finger as the most informative item of the DAS28-CRP for PsA activity staging. This symptom alone allowed a machine learned (random forests) classifier to identify PsA remission with 67% balanced accuracy in new cases. Projection of the DAS28-CRP data onto an emergent self-organizing map of artificial neurons identified outliers, which following augmentation of group sizes by emergent self-organizing maps based generative artificial intelligence (AI) could be defined as subgroups particularly characterized by either tenderness or swelling of specific joints. AI-assisted re-evaluation of the DAS28-CRP for PsA has narrowed the score items to a most relevant symptom, and generative AI has been useful for identifying and characterizing small subgroups of patients whose symptom patterns differ from the majority. These findings represent an important step toward precision medicine that can address outliers.",

This paper presents an efficient and accurate design methodology for graphene-based gradient-index phononic crystal (GGPC) lenses by combing theoretical formulations and machine learning methods. The GGPC lenses consist of two-dimensional phononic crystals possessing square unit cells with graphene-based composite inclusions. The plane wave expansion method is exploited to obtain the dispersion relations of elastic waves in the structures and then establish the data sets of the effective refractive indices in structures with different volume fractions of graphene fillers in composite materials and filling fractions of inclusions. Based on the database established by the theoretical formulation, genetic programming, a superior machine learning algorithm, is introduced to generate explicit mathematical expressions to predict the effective refractive indices under different structural information. The design of GGPC lenses is conducted with the assistance of the machine learning prediction model, and it will be illustrated by several typical design examples. The proposed design method offers high efficiency, accuracy as well as the ability to achieve inverse design of GGPC lenses, thus significantly facilitating the development of novel phononic crystal lenses and acoustic energy focusing.",

Theoretical and robophysical models typically emphasize body kinematics and active neural/electronic control. However, we contend that because such approaches often neglect the role of passive, mechanically controlled processes (those involving \"mechanical intelligence\"), they fail to reproduce the performance of even the simplest organisms. To uncover principles of how mechanical intelligence aids limbless locomotion in heterogeneous terradynamic regimes, here we conduct a comparative study of locomotion in a model of heterogeneous terrain (lattices of rigid posts). We used a model biological system, the highly studied nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, and a robophysical device whose bilateral actuator morphology models that of limbless organisms across scales. The robot's kinematics quantitatively reproduced the performance of the nematodes with purely open-loop control; mechanical intelligence simplified control of obstacle navigation and exploitation by reducing the need for active sensing and feedback. An active behavior observed in C. elegans, undulatory wave reversal upon head collisions, robustified locomotion via exploitation of the systems' mechanical intelligence. Our study provides insights into how neurally simple limbless organisms like nematodes can leverage mechanical intelligence via appropriately tuned bilateral actuation to locomote in complex environments. These principles likely apply to neurally more sophisticated organisms and also provide a design and control paradigm for limbless robots for applications like search and rescue and planetary exploration.",

Critical to the successful deployment of these tools is their functional integration into existing clinical routines and workflows. This depends on system interoperability and on intuitive and safe user interface design. The importance of minimizing emergent workflow stress through human factors research and purposeful design for integration cannot be overstated. Usability of tools in practice is as important as algorithm quality. Regulatory and health technology assessment frameworks recognize the importance of these factors to a certain extent, but their focus remains mainly on the individual product rather than on emergent system and workflow effects. The measurement of performance and user experience has so far been performed in ad hoc, nonstandardized ways by individual actors using their own evaluation approaches. We propose that a standard framework for system-level and holistic evaluation could be built into interacting digital systems to enable systematic and standardized system-wide, multiproduct, postmarket surveillance and technology assessment. Such a system could be made available to developers through regulatory or assessment bodies as an application programming interface and could be a requirement for digital tool certification, just as interoperability is. This would enable health systems and tool developers to collect system-level data directly from real device use cases, enabling the controlled and safe delivery of systematic quality assessment or improvement studies suitable for the complexity and interconnectedness of clinical workflows using developing digital health technologies.",

            "chunk": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In 2017, the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) introduced the inclusion of extracapsular nodal extension (ENE) into the N staging of nonviral head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), while retaining the traditional N classification based on the number and sizes of metastatic nodes. The extent of ENE was further defined as microscopic ENE (ENEmi) and major ENE (ENEma) based on extent of disease beyond the nodal capsule (</= or > 2 mm). This article reviews the evidence and progress made since these changes were introduced. RECENT FINDINGS: The 'gold standard' for evaluation ENE is histopathologic examination, the current preferred primary treatment of patients with HNSCC is by radiation-based therapy +/- chemotherapy or biotherapy. The current pretreatment staging is by imaging, which needs improved reliability of radiologic rENE assessment with reporting needs to consider both sensitivity and specificity (currently computed tomography images have high-specificity but low-sensitivity). Adjuvant chemotherapy is indicated for patients with ENEma to enhance disease control, whereas for patients with ENEmi, there is a need to assess the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy. Evidence that the presence of pENE in HPV-positive oropharyngeal carcinoma is an independent prognostic factor and should be considered for inclusion in future AJCC editions has recently emerged. SUMMARY: There remains a paucity of data on the reliability of imaging in the staging of rENE, more so the for the accurate assessment of ENEmi. Optimistic early results from use of artificial intelligence/deep learning demonstrate progress and may pave the way for better capabilities in tumor staging, treatment outcome prediction, resulting in improved survival outcomes.",

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted between April and May 2023 to assess PharmD students' perceptions, concerns, and experiences regarding the integration of ChatGPT into clinical pharmacy education. The study utilized a convenient sampling method through online platforms and involved a questionnaire with sections on demographics, perceived benefits, concerns, and experience with ChatGPT. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS, including descriptive and inferential analyses. RESULTS: The findings of the study involving 211 PharmD students revealed that the majority of participants were male (77.3%), and had prior experience with artificial intelligence (68.2%). Over two-thirds were aware of ChatGPT. Most students (n= 139, 65.9%) perceived potential benefits in using ChatGPT for various clinical tasks, with concerns including over-reliance, accuracy, and ethical considerations. Adoption of ChatGPT in clinical training varied, with some students not using it at all, while others utilized it for tasks like evaluating drug-drug interactions and developing care plans. Previous users tended to have higher perceived benefits and lower concerns, but the differences were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Utilizing ChatGPT in clinical training offers opportunities, but students' lack of trust in it for clinical decisions highlights the need for collaborative human-ChatGPT decision-making. It should complement healthcare professionals' expertise and be used strategically to compensate for human limitations. Further research is essential to optimize ChatGPT's effective integration.",

Computational intelligence (CI) in general and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms in particular have been shown to accelerate finding optimal printing parameters. Unfortunately, the implementation of CI has been prohibitively complex for noncomputer scientists. To overcome these limitations, this article develops, tests, and validates PSO Experimenter, an easy-to-use open-source platform based around the PSO algorithm and applies it to optimizing recycled materials. Specifically, PSO Experimenter is used to find optimal printing parameters for a relatively unexplored potential distributed recycling and additive manufacturing (DRAM) material that is widely available: low-density polyethylene (LDPE). LDPE has been used to make filament, but in this study for the first time it was used in the open source fused particle fabrication/fused granular fabrication system. PSO Experimenter successfully identified functional printing parameters for this challenging-to-print waste plastic. The results indicate that PSO Experimenter can provide 97% reduction in research time for 3D printing parameter optimization. It is concluded that the PSO Experimenter is a user-friendly and effective free software for finding ideal parameters for the burgeoning challenge of DRAM as well as a wide range of other fields and processes.",

However, there is growing recognition that the supportive environment (or ecosystem) around an individual plays an important role in finding and maintaining work. Programs at the ecosystem-level can be established by coordinating support before high school ends. Cocreation of a vocational program by support providers can facilitate an integrated effort to prepare autistic youth for employment. In this study, we describe and evaluate the Job-Train Program (JTP), a vocational program for autistic high school students codesigned with educators and a community-based social services agency. A school board, community-based social services agency, and academics partnered to cocreate JTP. JTP combined skill teaching and paid supported employment on a university campus. This pilot study evaluated JTP using qualitative and quantitative data. Twelve autistic youth were recruited, aged 15-18 years (10 males, 2 females) with an average intelligence quotient of 101.9 (standard deviation = 14.4), from the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence-2. Youth and parents completed self-report measures (pre-post), including the primary outcome, Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM). Post-JTP, interviews, focus groups, and surveys collected additional information from youth (n = 11), parents (n = 10), job coaches (n = 5), and employers (n = 8). Youth COPM scores indicated significant improvements in self-perceived ratings of skill performance (z = -2.5, p = 0.01) and satisfaction (z = -2.6, p = 0.01). Qualitative data corroborated COPM results noting youth skill improvements in self-esteem, independence, communication, and understanding work. Findings demonstrated a promising vocational training model for autistic high school students informing the development of integrated service pathways to support preparation for employment.",

However, the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on the breast cancer screening process has not yet been fully elucidated in terms of potential workload reduction. We aim to assess if AI-based triaging of breast cancer screening mammograms could reduce the radiologist's workload with non-inferior sensitivity. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Central, and Web of Science databases were systematically searched for studies that evaluated AI algorithms on computer-aided triage of breast cancer screening mammograms. We extracted data from homogenous studies and performed a proportion meta-analysis with a random-effects model to examine the radiologist's workload reduction (proportion of low-risk mammograms that could be theoretically ruled out from human's assessment) and the software's sensitivity to breast cancer detection. RESULTS: Thirteen studies were selected for full review, and three studies that used the same commercially available DL algorithm were included in the meta-analysis. In the 156,852 examinations included, the threshold of 7 was identified as optimal. With these parameters, radiologist workload decreased by 68.3% (95%CI 0.655-0.711, I(2) = 98.76%, p < 0.001), while achieving a sensitivity of 93.1% (95%CI 0.882-0.979, I(2) = 83.86%, p = 0.002) and a specificity of 68.7% (95% CI 0.684-0.723, I(2) = 97.5%, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The deployment of DL computer-aided triage of breast cancer screening mammograms reduces the radiology workload while maintaining high sensitivity.

We searched six databases to cover both health- and computer-science literature.

All full texts were retrieved, screened, and extracted by a single reviewer and 10% were checked in duplicate. We included 84 papers covering automation for health-related social media, internet fora, news, patents, government agencies and charities, or trial registers. From each paper, we extracted data about important functionalities for users of the tool or method; information about the level of support and reliability; and about practical challenges and research gaps.

Real-time auto-segmentation can assist gynaecologists in identifying the ureter and reduce intraoperative injury risk. METHODS: A deep learning segmentation model was crafted for ureter recognition in surgical videos, utilising 3368 frames from 11 laparoscopic surgeries. Class activation maps enhanced the model's interpretability, showing its areas. The model's clinical relevance was validated through an End-User Turing test and verified by three gynaecological surgeons. RESULTS: The model registered a Dice score of 0.86, a Hausdorff 95 distance of 22.60, and processed images in 0.008 s on average. In complex surgeries, it pinpointed the ureter's position in real-time. Fifty five surgeons across eight institutions found the model's accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity comparable to human performance. Yet, artificial intelligence experience influenced some subjective ratings. CONCLUSIONS: The model offers precise real-time ureter segmentation in laparoscopic surgery and can be a significant tool for gynaecologists to mitigate ureteral injuries.",

We selected a state-of-the-art AI system for breast cancer detection trained using a large US dataset. The selected baseline system was evaluated in two experimental settings. First, we examined our private Finnish sample as an independent test set that had not been considered in the development of the system (unseen population). Second, the baseline system was retrained to attempt to improve its performance in the unseen population by means of transfer learning. To analyze performance, we used areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) with DeLong's test. RESULTS: Two versions of the baseline system were considered: ImageOnly and Heatmaps. The ImageOnly and Heatmaps versions yielded mean AUC values of 0.82+/-0.008 and 0.88+/-0.003 in the US dataset and 0.56 (95% CI=0.50-0.62) and 0.72 (95% CI=0.67-0.77) when evaluated in the unseen population, respectively. The retrained systems achieved AUC values of 0.61 (95% CI=0.55-0.66) and 0.69 (95% CI=0.64-0.75), respectively.

            "chunk": "BACKGROUND: Cerebral palsy, hereinafter referred to as \"cerebral palsy\", refers to a non progressive injury that occurs during the development of brain tissue in fetuses or infants. The patients often have walking dysfunction, abnormal balance ability and abnormal body stability, which are mainly caused by Cranial nerves injury. PATIENT CONCERNS: One child diagnosed with ataxia cerebral palsy by the hospital was recruited, aged 6 years and 9 months. The symptoms were: lower limb adduction and internal rotation, left neck tilt to the left due to insufficient muscle tension, and eyes squint to the right. The movement is clumsy and the coordination ability of limbs is poor; Its body balance function is poor, the sitting and standing position cannot keep the body upright and balanced for a long time, and the coordination of the random movement of hands and eyes is poor; Weak spatial cognition and orientation ability; Have persistent central motor dysfunction. When walking, the body leans forward and sideways, and the gait is staggered, which is easy to fall; In terms of expression, it shows vague language and unclear speech; Relatively retarded in intelligence. DIAGNOSIS AND INTERVENTION: The study used swimming training intervention to report a twelve months training intervention program for a child with ataxic cerebral palsy, and evaluated it with Berg balance scale and modified Ashworth scale. OUTCOMES: Swimming training has a significant effect on the rehabilitation of children with ataxic cerebral palsy; The forces from different directions in the water can improve the balance of children with cerebral palsy; Muscle endurance training with medium load intensity can help restore unilateral muscle tension deficiency to a certain extent, and make bilateral muscle tension gradually becomes.consistent, thus enhancing the balance ability, gait and body stability of children with cerebral palsy.",

            "chunk-id": 1,
            "chunk": "BACKGROUND: The era of digitalization has arrived in the field of dentistry. Teledentistry (TD), the use of digital solutions in dentistry, is already used in practice; however, only some possibilities are considered. During the COVID-19 pandemic, remote patient monitoring and patient communication had to be solved with TD, thus causing a rapid spread of new tools. In addition to digital workflows, patient communication, AI, and online forums are also available. METHODS: An online self-administered survey was developed for the study. The Hungarian Medical Chamber contacted potential respondents in a newsletter or e-mail. The Evasys survey system was used. The weighting procedure was executed for gender, age group, and type of settlement. A digital dental index variable was created and built with a linear regression model as a dependent variable. Explanatory variables are advantages, disadvantages, what would be necessary, experienced needs from the patients, and age. RESULTS: A total of 171 dentists completed the survey. The best-known digital technologies are online conferences (96.5%), E-prescriptions (94.6%), and digital impressions (86.0%). Unawareness is the highest in the field of artificial intelligence in dentistry (50.5%), store-forward solutions (43.5%), and real-time solutions (41.8%). The digital dental index is 14.24 (standard deviation (SD) = 5.5), with a high power of the model. CONCLUSION: Hungarian dentists need to be made aware of all the possibilities of TD. In addition to digital workflows, store-forward and real-time solutions can be beneficial to substitute face-to-face visits. TD can be used effectively to monitor oral cavity changes and develop dental confidence and proper oral care habits. Our survey suggests that it is necessary and inevitable to integrate TD into both graduate and postgraduate education, which may form the basis of primary health care in the next decade.",

            "chunk": "BACKGROUND: Ethical issues may pose challenges to nursing students entering clinical practice. Moral sensitivity can assist them in recognising existing moral situations and then taking adequate action. Identifying the variables associated with moral sensitivity may be useful in preparing to improve nursing students' moral sensitivity. OBJECTIVES: This study investigated empathy, emotional intelligence, and moral sensitivity in Chinese student nurses to explore the association among these three factors and to verify the mediating function of emotional intelligence in determining the connection between empathy and moral sensitivity. DESIGN: This study used a cross-sectional correlational design. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Through convenience sampling, 239 fourth-year nursing undergraduates at a university in Western China were enrolled in this study. METHODS: Nursing students who volunteered to participate in the study completed self-reported scales on empathy, emotional intelligence, and moral sensitivity between September and October 2022. The potential mediating effect was explored using the Process Macro and bootstrap method. RESULTS: The nursing students' average scores were 39.62 +/- 5.27 on moral sensitivity, 108.21 +/- 15.49 on empathy, and 124.41 +/- 13.66 on EI. Moral sensitivity was positively correlated with emotional intelligence (r = 0.454, p < 0.001) and empathy (r = 0.545, p < 0.001). Furthermore, empathy exerted a substantial direct effect on nursing students' moral sensitivity (B = 0.1424, p < 0.001). Emotional intelligence could mediate the indirect path from empathy to moral sensitivity. (B = 0.0372, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Emotional intelligence mediated the association between empathy and moral sensitivity. Thus, educational activities and programmes placing an emphasis on empathy and emotional intelligence may offer an alternative way to promote moral sensitivity in Chinese student nurses. IMPLICATIONS: Nursing educators can organise programmes to improve nursing students' emotional competence and professional values. Early exposure to clinical practice benefits nursing students a lot in terms of building interactions with patients and increasing emotional resonance. In addition, nursing educators should develop situational teaching in nursing ethics courses to help students cope with ethical issues.",

AA is a common cause of emergency department visits and abdominal surgeries. It is typically diagnosed through clinical assessments, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. However, traditional diagnostic methods can be time-consuming and inaccurate. Machine learning models have shown promise in improving diagnostic accuracy and predicting outcomes. MAIN BODY: A systematic review following the PRISMA guidelines was conducted, searching PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. Studies were evaluated for risk of bias using the Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool. Data points extracted included model type, input features, validation strategies, and key performance metrics. RESULTS: In total, 29 studies were analyzed, out of which 21 focused on diagnosis, seven on prognosis, and one on both. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) were the most commonly employed algorithm for diagnosis. Both ANN and logistic regression were also widely used for categorizing types of AA. ANNs showed high performance in most cases, with accuracy rates often exceeding 80% and AUC values peaking at 0.985. The models also demonstrated promising results in predicting postoperative outcomes such as sepsis risk and ICU admission. Risk of bias was identified in a majority of studies, with selection bias and lack of internal validation being the most common issues. CONCLUSION: AI algorithms demonstrate significant promise in diagnosing and prognosticating AA, often surpassing traditional methods and clinical scores such as the Alvarado scoring system in terms of speed and accuracy.",

            "chunk": "BACKGROUND: We have developed a clinical decision support system (CDSS) based on methods from artificial intelligence to support physiotherapists and patients in the decision-making process of managing musculoskeletal (MSK) pain disorders in primary care. The CDSS finds the most similar successful patients from the past to give treatment recommendations for a new patient. Using previous similar patients with successful outcomes to advise treatment moves management of MSK pain patients from one-size fits all recommendations to more individually tailored treatment. This study aimed to summarise the development and explore the acceptance and use of the CDSS for MSK pain patients. METHODS: This qualitative study was carried out in the Norwegian physiotherapy primary healthcare sector between October and November 2020, ahead of a randomised controlled trial. We included four physiotherapists and three of their patients, in total 12 patients, with musculoskeletal pain in the neck, shoulder, back, hip, knee or complex pain. We conducted semi-structured telephone interviews with all participants. The interviews were analysed using the Framework Method. RESULTS: Overall, both the physiotherapists and patients found the system acceptable and usable. Important findings from the analysis of the interviews were that the CDSS was valued as a preparatory and exploratory tool, facilitating the therapeutic relationship. However, the physiotherapists used the system mainly to support their previous and current practice rather than involving patients to a greater extent in decisions and learning from previous successful patients. CONCLUSIONS: The CDSS was acceptable and usable to both the patients and physiotherapists. However, the system appeared not to considerably influence the physiotherapists' clinical reasoning and choice of treatment based on information from most similar successful patients. This could be due to a smaller than optimal number of previous patients in the CDSS or insufficient clinical implementation. Extensive training of physiotherapists should not be underestimated to build understanding and trust in CDSSs.",

In federated learning (FL), a model is trained collaboratively at numerous sites that hold local datasets without exchanging them. So far, the impact of training strategy, i.e., local versus collaborative, on the diagnostic on-domain and off-domain performance of AI models interpreting chest radiographs has not been assessed. Consequently, using 610,000 chest radiographs from five institutions across the globe, we assessed diagnostic performance as a function of training strategy (i.e., local vs. collaborative), network architecture (i.e., convolutional vs. transformer-based), single versus cross-institutional performance (i.e., on-domain vs. off-domain), imaging finding (i.e., cardiomegaly, pleural effusion, pneumonia, atelectasis, consolidation, pneumothorax, and no abnormality), dataset size (i.e., from n = 18,000 to 213,921 radiographs), and dataset diversity. Large datasets not only showed minimal performance gains with FL but, in some instances, even exhibited decreases. In contrast, smaller datasets revealed marked improvements. Thus, on-domain performance was mainly driven by training data size. However, off-domain performance leaned more on training diversity. When trained collaboratively across diverse external institutions, AI models consistently surpassed models trained locally for off-domain tasks, emphasizing FL's potential in leveraging data diversity. In conclusion, FL can bolster diagnostic privacy, reproducibility, and off-domain reliability of AI models and, potentially, optimize healthcare outcomes.",

With these goals in mind, we propose a novel comprehensive graph analytics based high level synthesis (GAHLS) framework that efficiently analyzes complex high level programs through a combined compiler-based approach and graph theoretic optimization and synthesizes them into message passing domain-specific accelerators. This GAHLS framework first constructs a compiler-assisted dependency graph (CaDG) from low level virtual machine (LLVM) intermediate representation (IR) of high level programs and converts it into a hardware friendly description representation. Next, the GAHLS framework performs a memory design space exploration while account for the identified computational properties from the CaDG and optimizing the system performance for higher bandwidth. The GAHLS framework also performs a robust optimization to identify the CaDG subgraphs with similar computational structures and aggregate them into intelligent processing clusters in order to optimize the usage of underlying hardware resources. Finally, the GAHLS framework synthesizes this compressed specialized CaDG into processing elements while optimizing the system performance and area metrics. Evaluations of the GAHLS framework on several real-life applications (e.g., deep learning, brain machine interfaces) demonstrate that it provides 14.27x performance improvements compared to state-of-the-art approaches such as LegUp 6.2.",

Despite their growing usage, there is a scarcity of comprehensive evaluations of their impact on mental health and well-being. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to fill this gap by synthesizing evidence on the effectiveness of AI-based CAs in improving mental health and factors influencing their effectiveness and user experience. Twelve databases were searched for experimental studies of AI-based CAs' effects on mental illnesses and psychological well-being published before May 26, 2023. Out of 7834 records, 35 eligible studies were identified for systematic review, out of which 15 randomized controlled trials were included for meta-analysis. The meta-analysis revealed that AI-based CAs significantly reduce symptoms of depression (Hedge's g 0.64 [95% CI 0.17-1.12]) and distress (Hedge's g 0.7 [95% CI 0.18-1.22]). These effects were more pronounced in CAs that are multimodal, generative AI-based, integrated with mobile/instant messaging apps, and targeting clinical/subclinical and elderly populations. However, CA-based interventions showed no significant improvement in overall psychological well-being (Hedge's g 0.32 [95% CI -0.13 to 0.78]). User experience with AI-based CAs was largely shaped by the quality of human-AI therapeutic relationships, content engagement, and effective communication. These findings underscore the potential of AI-based CAs in addressing mental health issues. Future research should investigate the underlying mechanisms of their effectiveness, assess long-term effects across various mental health outcomes, and evaluate the safe integration of large language models (LLMs) in mental health care.",

Accordingly, specific image processing techniques, such as time-frequency transforms, can be employed in conjunction with AI algorithms to enhance diagnostic accuracy. This research investigates the influence of non-data-adaptive time-frequency transforms, specifically X-lets, on the classification of OCT B-scans. For this purpose, each B-scan was transformed using every considered X-let individually, and all the sub-bands were utilized as the input for a designed 2D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract optimal features, which were subsequently fed to the classifiers. Evaluating per-class accuracy shows that the use of the 2D Discrete Wavelet Transform (2D-DWT) yields superior outcomes for normal cases, whereas the circlet transform outperforms other X-lets for abnormal cases characterized by circles in their retinal structure (due to the accumulation of fluid). As a result, we propose a novel transform named CircWave by concatenating all sub-bands from the 2D-DWT and the circlet transform. The objective is to enhance the per-class accuracy of both normal and abnormal cases simultaneously. Our findings show that classification results based on the CircWave transform outperform those derived from original images or any individual transform. Furthermore, Grad-CAM class activation visualization for B-scans reconstructed from CircWave sub-bands highlights a greater emphasis on circular formations in abnormal cases and straight lines in normal cases, in contrast to the focus on irrelevant regions in original B-scans. To assess the generalizability of our method, we applied it to another dataset obtained from a different imaging system. We achieved promising accuracies of 94.5% and 90% for the first and second datasets, respectively, which are comparable with results from previous studies. The proposed CNN based on CircWave sub-bands (i.e. CircWaveNet) not only produces superior outcomes but also offers more interpretable results with a heightened focus on features crucial for ophthalmologists.",

METHODS: Images were captured using the Heidelberg Spectralis 55-degree field-of-view and Optos ultra-wide field. The conventional mathematical warping was performed using Random Sample Consensus-Sample and Consensus sets (RANSAC-SC). This was compared to an AI alignment algorithm based on a one-way forward registration procedure consisting of full Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with Outlier Rejection (OR CNN), as well as an iterative 3D camera pose optimization process (OR CNN + Distortion Correction [DC]). Images were provided in a checkerboard pattern, and peripheral vessels were graded in four quadrants based on alignment to the adjacent box. RESULTS: A total of 660 boxes were analysed from 55 eyes. Dice scores were compared between the three methods (RANSAC-SC/OR CNN/OR CNN + DC): 0.3341/0.4665/4784 for fold 1-2 and 0.3315/0.4494/4596 for fold 2-1 in composite images. The images composed using the OR CNN + DC have a median rating of 4 (out of 5) versus 2 using RANSAC-SC. The odds of getting a higher grading level are 4.8 times higher using our OR CNN + DC than RANSAC-SC (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Peripheral retinal vessel alignment performed better using our AI algorithm than RANSAC-SC. This may help improve co-localizing retinal anatomy and pathology with our algorithm.",

Methods:The data of 75 patients with CRS who underwent nasal endoscopic surgery from October 2021 to February 2023 in the Department of Otorhinolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery, the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University were analyzed retrospectively. There were 53 males and 22 females enrolled in the study, with a median age of 42.0 years old. The CRS intelligent microscope interpretation system was used to calculate the proportion of area glands and blood vessels occupy in the pathological sections of each patient, and the absolute value and proportion of eosinophils, lymphocytes, plasma cells and neutrophils. The patients were grouped according to the results of the Sniffin' Sticks smell test, and the clinical baseline data, differences in nasal mucosal histopathological characteristics, laboratory test indicators and sinus CT were compared between the groups.

With the increase in social and economic pressures, the growing use of electronic devices and the accelerated aging process of the population, insufficient sleep and its hazards have drawn widespread attention from researchers in China and abroad. Sleep deprivation refers to a decrease in sleep or a severe lack of sleep due to various reasons. Previous studies have found that sleep deprivation can cause extensive damage to the body, including an increased incidence and mortality rate of neuropathic diseases in the brain, cardiovascular diseases, imbalances in the gut microbiota, and other multi-organ diseases. The mechanisms underlying the occurrence of multi-system and multi-organ diseases due to sleep deprivation mainly involve oxidative stress, inflammatory responses, and impaired immune function in the body. According to traditional Chinese medicine(TCM), sleep deprivation falls into the category of sleepiness, and long-term sleepiness leads to Yin-Yang imbalance, resulting in the consumption of Qi and damage to the five Zang-organs. The appropriate treatment should focus on tonifying deficiency, reinforcing healthy Qi, and harmonizing Yin and Yang. TCM is characterized by a wide variety and abundant resources, and it has minimal side effects and a broad range of applications. Numerous studies have shown that TCM drugs and prescriptions not only improve sleep but also have beneficial effects on liver nourishment, intelligence enhancement, and kidney tonification, effectively preventing and treating the body injury caused by sleep deprivation. Given the increasing prevalence of sleep deprivation and its significant impact on body health, this article reviewed sleep deprivation-mediated body injury and its mechanism, summarized and categorized TCM compound prescriptions and single drugs for preventing and treating body injury, with the aim of laying the foundation for researchers to develop effective drugs for preventing and treating body injury caused by sleep deprivation and providing references for further exploration of the molecular mechanisms underlying the body injury caused by sleep deprivation.",

Based on the transfer learning method, a series of research results have been obtained on the optimal image recognition and analysis of static images. However, for carotid plaque recognition, there are high requirements for self-developed algorithms in real-time ultrasound detection. This study aims to establish an automatic recognition system, Be Easy to Use (BETU), for the real-time and synchronous diagnosis of carotid plaque from ultrasound videos based on an artificial neural network. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 445 participants (mean age, 54.6+/-7.8 years; 227 men) were evaluated. Radiologists labeled a total of 3259 segmented ultrasound images from 445 videos with the diagnosis of carotid plaque, 2725 images were collected as a training dataset, and 554 images as a testing dataset. The automatic plaque recognition system BETU was established based on an artificial neural network, and remote application on a 5G environment was performed to test its diagnostic performance. RESULTS: The diagnostic accuracy of BETU (98.5%) was consistent with the radiologist's (Kappa = 0.967, P < 0.001). Remote diagnostic feedback based on BETU-processed ultrasound videos could be obtained in 150ms across a distance of 1023 km between the ultrasound/BETU station and the consultation workstation.

This study aimed to investigate the significance of employing artificial intelligence (AI) in the field of endoscopy, specifically in diagnosing colorectal lesions. The research was conducted under the supervision of experienced professionals and trainees. METHODS: EMBASE, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) database, and other potential databases were surveyed for articles related to the EC with AI published before September 2023. RevMan (5.40), Stata (14.0), and R software (4.1.0) were used for statistical assessment. Studies that measured the accuracy of EC using AI for colorectal lesions were included. Two authors independently assessed the selected studies and their extracted data. This included information such as the country, literature, total study population, study design, characteristics of the fundamental study and control groups, sensitivity, number of samples, assay methodology, specificity, true positives or negatives, and false positives or negatives. The diagnostic accuracy of EC by AI was determined by a bivariate random-effects model, avoiding a high heterogeneity effect. The ANOVA model was employed to determine the more effective approach. RESULTS: A total of 223 studies were reviewed; 8 articles were selected that included 2984 patients (4241 lesions) for systematic review and meta-analysis. AI assessed 4069 lesions; experts diagnosed 3165 and 5014 by trainees. AI demonstrated high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity levels in detecting colorectal lesions, with values of 0.93 (95% CI: 0.90, 0.95) and 0.94 (95% CI: 0.73, 0.99). Expert diagnosis was 0.90 (95% CI: 0.85, 0.94), 0.87 (95% CI: 0.78, 0.93), and trainee diagnosis was 0.74 (95% CI: 0.67, 0.79), 0.72 (95% CI: 0.62, 0.80). With the EC by AI, the AUC from SROC was 0.95 (95% CI: 0.93, 0.97), therefore classified as excellent category, expert showed 0.95 (95% CI: 0.93, 0.97), and the trainee had 0.79 (95% CI: 0.75, 0.82). The superior index from the ANOVA model was 4.00 (1.15,5.00), 2.00 (1.15,5.00), and 0.20 (0.20,0.20), respectively. The examiners conducted meta-regression and subgroup analyses to evaluate the presence of heterogeneity. The findings of these investigations suggest that the utilization of NBI technology was correlated with variability in sensitivity and specificity. There was a lack of solid evidence indicating the presence of publishing bias. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings indicate that using AI in EC can potentially enhance the efficiency of diagnosing colorectal abnormalities. As a valuable instrument, it can enhance prognostic outcomes in ordinary EC procedures, exhibiting superior diagnostic accuracy compared to trainee-level endoscopists and demonstrating comparability to expert endoscopists. The research is subject to certain constraints, namely a limited number of clinical investigations and variations in the methodologies used for identification. Consequently, it is imperative to conduct comprehensive and extensive research to enhance the precision of diagnostic procedures.",

Yet, given the interdisciplinary nature of the field, many findings have only been shared in their respective research community. An overview of XAI for omics data is needed to highlight promising approaches and help detect common issues. Toward this end, we conducted a systematic mapping study. To identify relevant literature, we queried Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, BioRxiv, MedRxiv and arXiv. Based on keywording, we developed a coding scheme with 10 facets regarding the studies' AI methods, explainability methods and omics data. Our mapping study resulted in 405 included papers published between 2010 and 2023. The inspected papers analyze DNA-based (mostly genomic), transcriptomic, proteomic or metabolomic data by means of neural networks, tree-based methods, statistical methods and further AI methods. The preferred post-hoc explainability methods are feature relevance (n = 166) and visual explanation (n = 52), while papers using interpretable approaches often resort to the use of transparent models (n = 83) or architecture modifications (n = 72). With many research gaps still apparent for XAI for omics data, we deduced eight research directions and discuss their potential for the field. We also provide exemplary research questions for each direction. Many problems with the adoption of XAI for omics data in clinical practice are yet to be resolved. This systematic mapping study outlines extant research on the topic and provides research directions for researchers and practitioners.",

OBJECTIVE: To explore the factors associated with organizational motivation to share health data for AI development. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This qualitative study investigated organizational readiness for sharing health data across the academic, governmental, nonprofit, and private sectors. Using a multiple case studies approach, 27 semistructured interviews were conducted with leaders in data-sharing roles from August 29, 2022, to January 9, 2023. The interviews were conducted in the English language using a video conferencing platform. Using a purposive and nonprobabilistic sampling strategy, 78 individuals across 52 unique organizations were identified. Of these, 35 participants were enrolled. Participant recruitment concluded after 27 interviews, as theoretical saturation was reached and no additional themes emerged. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: Concepts defining organizational readiness for data sharing and the association between data-sharing factors and organizational behavior were mapped through iterative qualitative analysis to establish a framework defining organizational readiness for sharing clinical data for AI development. RESULTS: Interviews included 27 leaders from 18 organizations (academia: 10, government: 7, nonprofit: 8, and private: 2). Organizational readiness for data sharing centered around 2 main constructs: motivation and capabilities. Motivation related to the alignment of an organization's values with data-sharing priorities and was associated with its engagement in data-sharing efforts. However, organizational motivation could be modulated by extrinsic incentives for financial or reputational gains. Organizational capabilities comprised infrastructure, people, expertise, and access to data. Cross-sector collaboration was a key strategy to mitigate barriers to access health data. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This qualitative study identified sector-specific factors that may affect the data-sharing behaviors of health organizations. External incentives may bolster cross-sector collaborations by helping overcome barriers to accessing health data for AI development. The findings suggest that tailored incentives may boost organizational motivation and facilitate sustainable flow of health data for AI development.",

            "chunk": "IMPORTANCE: Artificial intelligence (AI) could support clinicians when diagnosing hospitalized patients; however, systematic bias in AI models could worsen clinician diagnostic accuracy. Recent regulatory guidance has called for AI models to include explanations to mitigate errors made by models, but the effectiveness of this strategy has not been established. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the impact of systematically biased AI on clinician diagnostic accuracy and to determine if image-based AI model explanations can mitigate model errors. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized clinical vignette survey study administered between April 2022 and January 2023 across 13 US states involving hospitalist physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants. INTERVENTIONS: Clinicians were shown 9 clinical vignettes of patients hospitalized with acute respiratory failure, including their presenting symptoms, physical examination, laboratory results, and chest radiographs. Clinicians were then asked to determine the likelihood of pneumonia, heart failure, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as the underlying cause(s) of each patient's acute respiratory failure. To establish baseline diagnostic accuracy, clinicians were shown 2 vignettes without AI model input. Clinicians were then randomized to see 6 vignettes with AI model input with or without AI model explanations. Among these 6 vignettes, 3 vignettes included standard-model predictions, and 3 vignettes included systematically biased model predictions. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Clinician diagnostic accuracy for pneumonia, heart failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. RESULTS: Median participant age was 34 years (IQR, 31-39) and 241 (57.7%) were female. Four hundred fifty-seven clinicians were randomized and completed at least 1 vignette, with 231 randomized to AI model predictions without explanations, and 226 randomized to AI model predictions with explanations. Clinicians' baseline diagnostic accuracy was 73.0% (95% CI, 68.3% to 77.8%) for the 3 diagnoses. When shown a standard AI model without explanations, clinician accuracy increased over baseline by 2.9 percentage points (95% CI, 0.5 to 5.2) and by 4.4 percentage points (95% CI, 2.0 to 6.9) when clinicians were also shown AI model explanations. Systematically biased AI model predictions decreased clinician accuracy by 11.3 percentage points (95% CI, 7.2 to 15.5) compared with baseline and providing biased AI model predictions with explanations decreased clinician accuracy by 9.1 percentage points (95% CI, 4.9 to 13.2) compared with baseline, representing a nonsignificant improvement of 2.3 percentage points (95% CI, -2.7 to 7.2) compared with the systematically biased AI model. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Although standard AI models improve diagnostic accuracy, systematically biased AI models reduced diagnostic accuracy, and commonly used image-based AI model explanations did not mitigate this harmful effect.

This analysis compares the evaluation of histological features of NASH between pathologists and a machine-learning (ML) pathology model. APPROACH AND RESULTS: This post hoc analysis included data from a subset of patients (n=251) with biopsy-confirmed NASH and fibrosis stage F1-F3 from a 72-week randomized placebo-controlled trial of once-daily subcutaneous semaglutide 0.1, 0.2, or 0.4 mg (NCT02970942). Biopsies at baseline and week 72 were read by 2 pathologists. Digitized biopsy slides were evaluated by PathAI's NASH ML models to quantify changes in fibrosis, steatosis, inflammation, and hepatocyte ballooning using categorical assessments and continuous scores. Pathologist and ML-derived categorical assessments detected a significantly greater percentage of patients achieving the primary endpoint of NASH resolution without worsening of fibrosis with semaglutide 0.4 mg versus placebo (pathologist 58.5% vs. 22.0%, p < 0.0001; ML 36.9% vs. 11.9%; p =0.0015). Both methods detected a higher but nonsignificant percentage of patients on semaglutide 0.4 mg versus placebo achieving the secondary endpoint of liver fibrosis improvement without NASH worsening. ML continuous scores detected significant treatment-induced responses in histological features, including a quantitative reduction in fibrosis with semaglutide 0.4 mg versus placebo ( p =0.0099) that could not be detected using pathologist or ML categorical assessment. CONCLUSIONS: ML categorical assessments reproduced pathologists' results of histological improvement with semaglutide for steatosis and disease activity. ML-based continuous scores demonstrated an antifibrotic effect not measured by conventional histopathology.",

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and methods: We utilized 50 clinical cases, employing Large Language Model ChatGPT-3.5. The experiment had three phases, each with a new chat setup. In the initial phase, ChatGPT received detailed clinical case descriptions, guided by a \"Persona Pattern\" prompt. In the second phase, cases with diagnostic errors were addressed by providing potential diagnoses for ChatGPT to choose from. The final phase assessed artificial intelligence's ability to mimic a medical practitioner's diagnostic process, with prompts limiting initial information to symptoms and history. RESULTS: Results: In the initial phase, ChatGPT showed a 66.00% diagnostic accuracy, surpassing physicians by nearly 50%. Notably, in 11 cases requiring image inter notpretation, ChatGPT struggled initially but achieved a correct diagnosis for four without added interpretations. In the second phase, ChatGPT demonstrated a remarkable 70.59% diagnostic accuracy, while physicians averaged 41.47%. Furthermore, the overall accuracy of Large Language Model in first and second phases together was 90.00%. In the third phase emulating real doctor decision-making, ChatGPT achieved a 46.00% success rate. CONCLUSION: Conclusions: Our research underscores ChatGPT's strong potential in clinical medicine as a diagnostic tool, especially in structured scenarios.

            "chunk": "Background Generative artificial intelligence (AI) models, exemplified by systems such as ChatGPT, Bard, and Anthropic, are currently under intense investigation for their potential to address existing gaps in mental health support. One implementation of these large language models involves the development of mental health-focused conversational agents, which utilize pre-structured prompts to facilitate user interaction without requiring specialized knowledge in prompt engineering. However, uncertainties persist regarding the safety and efficacy of these agents in recognizing severe depression and suicidal tendencies. Given the well-established correlation between the severity of depression and the risk of suicide, improperly calibrated conversational agents may inadequately identify and respond to crises. Consequently, it is crucial to investigate whether publicly accessible repositories of mental health-focused conversational agents can consistently and safely address crisis scenarios before considering their adoption in clinical settings. This study assesses the safety of publicly available ChatGPT-3.5 conversational agents by evaluating their responses to a patient simulation indicating worsening depression and suicidality. Methodology This study evaluated ChatGPT-3.5 conversational agents on a publicly available repository specifically designed for mental health counseling. Each conversational agent was evaluated twice by a highly structured patient simulation. First, the simulation indicated escalating suicide risk based on the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). For the second patient simulation, the escalating risk was presented in a more generalized manner not associated with an existing risk scale to assess the more generalized ability of the conversational agent to recognize suicidality. Each simulation recorded the exact point at which the conversational agent recommended human support. Then, the simulation continued until the conversational agent stopped entirely and shut down completely, insisting on human intervention. Results All 25 agents available on the public repository FlowGPT.com were evaluated. The point at which the conversational agents referred to a human occurred around the mid-point of the simulation, and definitive shutdown predominantly only happened at the highest risk levels. For the PHQ-9 simulation, the average initial referral and shutdown aligned with PHQ-9 scores of 12 (moderate depression) and 25 (severe depression). Few agents included crisis resources - only two referenced suicide hotlines. Despite the conversational agents insisting on human intervention, 22 out of 25 agents would eventually resume the dialogue if the simulation reverted to a lower risk level. Conclusions Current generative AI-based conversational agents are slow to escalate mental health risk scenarios, postponing referral to a human to potentially dangerous levels. More rigorous testing and oversight of conversational agents are needed before deployment in mental healthcare settings. Additionally, further investigation should explore if sustained engagement worsens outcomes and whether enhanced accessibility outweighs the risks of improper escalation. Advancing AI safety in mental health remains imperative as these technologies continue rapidly advancing.",

            "chunk": "INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic had a global impact and created an unprecedented emergency in healthcare and other related frontline sectors. Various Artificial-Intelligence-based models were developed to effectively manage medical resources and identify patients at high risk. However, many of these AI models were limited in their practical high-risk applicability due to their \"black-box\" nature, i.e., lack of interpretability of the model. To tackle this problem, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) was introduced, aiming to explore the \"black box\" behavior of machine learning models and offer definitive and interpretable evidence. XAI provides interpretable analysis in a human-compliant way, thus boosting our confidence in the successful implementation of AI systems in the wild. METHODS: In this regard, this study explores the use of model-agnostic XAI models, such as SHapley Additive exPlanations values (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), for COVID-19 symptom analysis in Indian patients toward a COVID severity prediction task. Various machine learning models such as Decision Tree Classifier, XGBoost Classifier, and Neural Network Classifier are leveraged to develop Machine Learning models. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The proposed XAI tools are found to augment the high performance of AI systems with human interpretable evidence and reasoning, as shown through the interpretation of various explainability plots. Our comparative analysis illustrates the significance of XAI tools and their impact within a healthcare context. The study suggests that SHAP and LIME analysis are promising methods for incorporating explainability in model development and can lead to better and more trustworthy ML models in the future.",

This study evaluates the performance of the GPT-4.0 large language model in responding to plastic surgery board examination questions and explores its potential as a learning tool. METHODS: We used a selection of 50 questions from 19 different chapters of a widely-used plastic surgery reference. Responses generated by the GPT-4.0 model were assessed based on four parameters: accuracy, clarity, completeness, and conciseness. Correlation analyses were conducted to ascertain the relationship between these parameters and the overall performance of the model. RESULTS: GPT-4.0 showed a strong performance with high mean scores for accuracy (2.88), clarity (3.00), completeness (2.88), and conciseness (2.92) on a three-point scale. Completeness of the model's responses was significantly correlated with accuracy (P < 0.0001), whereas no significant correlation was found between accuracy and clarity or conciseness. Performance variability across different chapters indicates potential limitations of the model in dealing with certain complex topics in plastic surgery. CONCLUSIONS: The GPT-4.0 model exhibits considerable potential as an auxiliary tool for preparation for plastic surgery board examinations. Despite a few identified limitations, the generally high scores on key parameters suggest the model's ability to provide responses that are accurate, clear, complete, and concise. Future research should focus on enhancing the performance of artificial intelligence models in complex medical topics, further improving their applicability in medical education.",

These tools have been employed to predict structures across entire proteomes and the results of large-scale metagenomic sequence studies, yielding an exponential increase in available biomolecular 3D structural information. Given the enormous volume of this newly computed biostructure data, there is an urgent need for robust tools to manage, search, cluster, and visualize large collections of structures. Equally important is the capability to efficiently summarize and visualize metadata, biological/biochemical annotations, and structural features, particularly when working with vast numbers of protein structures of both experimental origin from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and computationally-predicted models. Moreover, researchers require advanced visualization techniques that support interactive exploration of multiple sequences and structural alignments.

This study aims to use bibliometric analysis to explore the current research hotspots and collaborative networks in the application of medical imaging in OC from 2000 to 2022. METHODS: A systematica search for medical imaging in OC was conducted on the Web of Science Core Collection on August 9, 2023. All reviews and articles published from January 2000 to December 2022 were downloaded, and an analysis of countries, institutions, journals, keywords, and collaborative networks was perfomed using CiteSpace and VOSviewer. RESULTS: A total of 5,958 publications were obtained, demonstrating a clear upward trend in annual publications over the study peroid. The USA led in productivity with 1,373 publications, and Harvard University emerged as the most prominent institution with 202 publications. Timmerman D was the most prolific contributor with 100 publications, and Gynecological Oncology led in the number of publications with 296. The top three keywords were \"ovarian cancer\" (1,256), \"ultrasound\" (725), and \"diagnosis\" (712). In addition, \"pelvic masses\" had the highest burst strength (25.5), followed by \"magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\" (21.47). Recent emergent keywords such as \"apoptosis\", \"nanoparticles\", \"features\", \"accuracy\", and \"human epididymal protein 4 (HE 4)\" reflect research trends in this field and may become research hotspots in the future. CONCLUSION: This study provides a comprehensive summary of the key contributions of OC imaging to field's development over the past 23 years. Presently, primary areas of OC imaging research include MRI, targeted therapy of OC, novel biomarker (HE 4), and artificial intelligence. These areas are expected to influence future research endeavors in this field.",

            "chunk": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 global pandemic has necessitated the urgency for innovative mental health interventions. We performed a comprehensive review of the available literature on the utility and efficacy of arts therapies in treating mental health problems, with special emphasis on their deployment during the COVID-19 pandemic, aiming to provide some evidence for the application of this therapy. METHODS: The potential studies were systematically sourced from five authoritative databases: PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and the CNKI database. The evaluation of these studies was conducted based on stringent criteria, including validity, suitability, therapeutic potential, and consistency. Each piece of included literature was meticulously scored in accordance with these criteria, thus ensuring the inclusion of only the most robust studies in this review. The data from these Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) were carefully extracted using the PICO(S) framework, ensuring a comprehensive and systemic approach to data collection. In order to emphasize the variability in the effects of differing arts therapies on COVID-19-induced psychiatric disturbances, the sourced literature was systematically categorized and scrutinized based on distinct modalities. RESULTS: Out of the 7,250 sourced articles, 16 satisfied the inclusion conditions. The therapies were predominantly meditation (n = 7), supplemented by individual studies on color therapy (n = 3), music therapy (n = 2), and single studies on horticultural therapy, dance therapy, mindfulness and music therapy, and yoga and music therapy (n = 4 collectively). These various forms of arts therapies had a positive short to medium-term impact on the mental health of COVID-19 patients. Besides improving patients' physical and mental health, these therapies can also be employed to mitigate mental health issues among healthcare professionals. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has profound and long-lasting implications for public mental health. Diverse forms of arts therapies are potentially effective in addressing related psychiatric symptoms. The integration of artificial intelligence might further enhance the efficacy and scalability of arts therapies in future implementations.",

Aesthetic motivation (the value or appreciation of aesthetic beauty) is linked with prosocial tendencies, raising the question of whether this factor is used in interpersonal reasoning and in the attribution of mental capacities. We propose and test a model of this reasoning, predicting that evidence of others' aesthetic motivations should impact judgments of others' prosocial (and antisocial) tendencies by signaling a heightened capacity for emotional experience. In a series of four pre-registered experiments (total N = 1440), participants saw pairs of characters (as photos/vignettes), and judged which in each pair showed more of a mental capacity of interest. Distractor items prevented participants from guessing the hypothesis. For one critical pair of characters, both characters performed the same activity (music listening, painting, cooking, exercising, being in nature, doing math), but one was motivated by the activities' aesthetic value, and the other by its functional value. Across all activities, participants robustly chose aesthetically-motivated characters as more likely to behave compassionately (Exp. 1; 3), less likely to behave selfishly/manipulatively (Exp. 1; 3), and as more emotionally sensitive, but not more intelligent (Exp. 2; 3; 4). Emotional sensitivity best predicted compassionate behavior judgements (Exp. 3). Aesthetically-motivated characters were not reliably chosen as more helpful; intelligence best predicted helpfulness judgements (Exp. 4). Evidence of aesthetic motivation conveys important social information about others, impacting fundamental interpersonal judgments about others' mental life and social behavior.",

This study aims to investigate whether Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4) is equal to humans in writing introduction sections for scientific articles. Methods This randomized non-inferiority study was reported according to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials for non-inferiority trials and artificial intelligence (AI) guidelines. GPT-4 was instructed to synthesize 18 introduction sections based on the aim of previously published studies, and these sections were compared to the human-written introductions already published in a medical journal. Eight blinded assessors randomly evaluated the introduction sections using 1-10 Likert scales. Results There was no significant difference between GPT-4 and human introductions regarding publishability and content quality. GPT-4 had one point significantly better scores in readability, which was considered a non-relevant difference. The majority of assessors (59%) preferred GPT-4, while 33% preferred human-written introductions. Based on Lix and Flesch-Kincaid scores, GPT-4 introductions were 10 and two points higher, respectively, indicating that the sentences were longer and had longer words. Conclusion GPT-4 was found to be equal to humans in writing introductions regarding publishability, readability, and content quality. The majority of assessors preferred GPT-4 introductions and less than half could determine which were written by GPT-4 or humans. These findings suggest that GPT-4 can be a useful tool for writing introduction sections, and further studies should evaluate its ability to write other parts of scientific articles.",

The case study uses the Northern Ireland Longitudinal Study (NILS), a member of the UK family of census/administrative data longitudinal studies (UKLS). METHODS: A stakeholder-engaged CI approach was applied to inform the transformation of the NILS Research Support Unit (RSU) infrastructure to support researchers in their use of government data, including collaborative decision-making and better dissemination of research outputs. RESULTS: We provide an overview of NILS RSU infrastructure design changes that have been implemented to date, focusing on a website redesign to meet user information requirements and the formation of better working partnerships between data users and providers within the Northern Ireland data landscape. We also discuss the key challenges faced by the design team during this project of transformation. CONCLUSION: Our primary objective to improve government data infrastructure and to increase dissemination and the impact of research based on data was a complex and multifaceted challenge due to the number of stakeholders involved and their often conflicting perspectives. Results from this CI approach have been pivotal in highlighting how NILS RSU can work collaboratively with users to maximize the potential of this data, in terms of forming multidisciplinary networks to ensure the research is utilized in policy and in the literature and providing academic support and resources to attract new researchers.",

An Elderly and Visually Impaired Human Activity Monitoring (EV-HAM) system that keeps tabs on a person's routine and steps in if a change in behaviour or a crisis might greatly help an elderly person or a visually impaired. These individuals may find greater freedom with the help of an EVHAM system. As the backbone of human-centric applications like actively supported living and in-home monitoring for the elderly and visually impaired, an EVHAM system is essential. Big data-driven product design is flourishing in this age of 5G and the IoT. Recent advancements in processing power and software architectures have also contributed to the emergence and development of artificial intelligence (AI). In this context, the digital twin has emerged as a state-of-the-art technology that bridges the gap between the real and virtual worlds by evaluating data from several sensors using artificial intelligence algorithms. Although promising findings have been reported by Wi-Fi-based human activity identification techniques so far, their effectiveness is vulnerable to environmental variations. Using the environment-independent fingerprints generated from the Wi-Fi channel state information (CSI), we introduce Wi-Sense. This human activity identification system employs a Deep Hybrid convolutional neural network (DHCNN). The proposed system begins by collecting the CSI with a regular Wi-Fi Network Interface Controller. Wi-Sense uses the CSI ratio technique to lessen the effect of noise and the phase offset. The t- Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) is used to eliminate unnecessary data further. The data dimension is decreased, and the negative effects on the environment are eliminated in this process. The resulting spectrogram of the processed data exposes the activity's micro-Doppler fingerprints as a function of both time and location. These spectrograms are put to use in the training of a DHCNN. Based on our findings, EVHAM can accurately identify these actions 99% of the time.",

Furthermore, optimal LAV% cutoff values for predicting a FEV1/FVC < 70% or moderate to more extensive visual emphysema grades were calculated. METHODS: In a retrospective study of 298 consecutive patients who underwent routine chest CT and spirometry examinations, LAV% was quantified using an AI-based software with a threshold < -950 HU. The FEV1/FVC was derived from spirometry, with FEV1/FVC < 70% indicating airway obstruction. The mean time interval of CT from spirometry was 3.87 +/- 4.78 days. Severity of emphysema was visually graded by an experienced chest radiologist using an established 5-grade ordinal scale (Fleischner Society classification system). Spearman correlation coefficient between LAV% and FEV1/FVC was calculated. Receiver operating characteristic determined the optimal LAV% cutoff values for predicting a FEV1/FVC < 70% or a visual emphysema grade of moderate or higher (Fleischner grade 3-5). RESULTS: Significant correlation between LAV% and FEV1/FVC was found (varrho = -0.477, P < 0.001). Increasing LAV% corresponded to higher visual emphysema grades. For patients with absent visual emphysema, mean LAV% was 2.98 +/- 3.30, for patients with trace emphysema 3.22 +/- 2.75, for patients with mild emphysema 3.90 +/- 3.33, for patients with moderate emphysema 6.41 +/- 3.46, for patients with confluent emphysema 9.02 +/- 5.45, and for patients with destructive emphysema 16.90 +/- 8.19. Optimal LAV% cutoff value for predicting a FEV1/FVC < 70 was 6.1 (area under the curve = 0.764, sensitivity = 0.773, specificity = 0.665), while for predicting a visual emphysema grade of moderate or higher, it was 4.7 (area under the curve = 0.802, sensitivity = 0.766, specificity = 0.742). Furthermore, correlation between visual emphysema grading and FEV1/FVC was found. In patients with FEV1/FVC < 70% a high proportion of subjects had emphysema grade 3 (moderate) or higher, whereas in patients with FEV1/FVC >/= 70%, a larger proportion had emphysema grade 3 (moderate) or lower. The sensitivity for visual emphysema grading predicting a FEV1/FVC < 70% was 56.3% with an optimal cutoff point at a visual grade of 4 (confluent), demonstrating a lower sensitivity compared with LAV% (77.3%). CONCLUSIONS: A significant correlation between AI-based LAV% and FEV1/FVC as well as visual CT emphysema grades can be found in routine chest CT suggesting that AI-based LAV% measurement might be integrated as an add-on functional parameter in the evaluation of chest CT in the future.",

            "chunk": "OBJECTIVE: Mentalizing is an essential function of our social lives. Impairment of mentalizing due to meningiomas has not received attention because most patients return to their social lives after surgical treatment. We investigated the influence of meningiomas and their surgical resection on mentalizing. METHODS: Low- and high-level mentalizing were retrospectively examined in 61 patients with meningiomas and 14 healthy volunteers. Mentalizing was assessed using the facial expression recognition test and picture arrangement test of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, third edition, before and after surgery. We examined the influence of tumor localization on mentalizing and recovery from mentalizing disorders after tumor resection. Voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping was performed to investigate the relationship between impairments in mentalizing and tumor location. RESULTS: Before surgery, mentalizing was impaired significantly in patients with meningiomas compared to those in the control group (low-level: P = 0.015, high-level: P = 0.011). This impairment was associated with contact between the tumor and frontal lobe (low-level: P = 0.036, high-level: P = 0.047) and was severe in patients with tumors arising in the anterior skull base (low-level: P = 0.0045, high-level: P = 0.043). Voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping revealed that when the basal cortex of the frontal lobe was compressed by the tumor, the risk of impaired mentalizing was high. The region responsible for high-level mentalizing was located deeper than that responsible for low-level mentalizing. After the surgical removal of the tumor, the test scores significantly improved (low-level: P = 0.035, high-level: P = 0.045). CONCLUSIONS: Mentalizing was impaired by meningiomas arising from the anterior skull base, but it can improve after surgical resection of the tumors.",

The implications of this relatively unique secondary use of data have not been well explored. These models can support the development of sophisticated AI products that can be commercialized. While these products have the potential to support and improve the educational system, there are challenges related to validity; patient and learner consent; and biased or discriminatory outputs.

            "chunk": "Clinical touch is the cornerstone of the doctor-patient relationship and can impact patient experience and outcomes. In the current era, driven by an ever-increasing infusion of point of care technologies, physical exam skills have become undervalued. Moreover, touch and hands-on skills have been difficult to teach due to inaccurate assessments and difficulty with learning transfer through observation. In this article, the authors argue that haptics, the science of touch, provides a unique opportunity to explore new pathways to facilitate touch training. Furthermore, haptics can dramatically increase the density of touch-based assessments without increasing human rater burden-essential for realizing precision assessment. The science of haptics is reviewed, including the benefits of using haptics-informed language for objective structured clinical examinations. The authors describe how haptic devices and haptic language have and can be used to facilitate learning, communication, documentation and a much-needed reinvigoration of physical examination and touch excellence at the point of care. The synergy of haptic devices, artificial intelligence, and virtual reality environments are discussed. The authors conclude with challenges of scaling haptic technology in medical education, such as cost and translational needs, and opportunities to achieve wider adoption of this transformative approach to precision education.",

            "chunk": "A central goal of precision education (PE) is efficiently delivering the right educational intervention to the right learner at the right time. This can be achieved through a PE cycle that involves gathering inputs, using analytics to generate insights, planning and implementing interventions, learning and assessing outcomes, and then using lessons learned to inform modifications to the cycle. In this paper the authors describe three PE initiatives utilizing this cycle. The Graduate Medical Education Laboratory (GEL) uses longitudinal data on graduate trainee behavior, clinical skills, and wellness to improve clinical performance and professional fulfillment. The Transition to Residency Advantage (TRA) program uses learner data from medical school coupled with individualized coaching to improve the transition to residency. The Anesthesia Research Group for Educational Technology (TARGET) is developing an automated tool to deliver individualized education to anesthesia residents based on a longitudinal digital representation of the learner. The authors discuss strengths of the PE cycle and transferrable learnings for future PE innovations. Common challenges are identified, including related to data (e.g., volume, variety, sharing across institutions, using the electronic health record), analytics (e.g., validating augmented intelligence models), and interventions (e.g., scaling up learner assessments with limited resources). PE developers need to share their experiences in order to overcome these challenges, develop best practices, and ensure ethical development of future systems. Adapting a common framework to develop and assess PE initiatives will lead to a clearer understanding of their impact, help to mitigate potential risks, and allow deployment of successful practices on a larger scale.",

            "chunk": "Aimed at sequential dynamic modes, a novel multimodal weighted canonical correlation analysis using an attention (MWCCA-A) mechanism is introduced to derive a single model for process monitoring, by integrating two ideas of replay and regularization in continual learning. Under the assumption that data are received sequentially, subsets of data from past modes with dynamic features are selected and stored as replay data, which are utilized together with the current mode data for continual model parameter estimation. The weighted canonical correlation analysis (WCCA) is introduced to achieve appropriate weightings of past modes' replay data so that the latent variables are extracted by maximizing the weighted correlation with its prediction via the attention mechanism. Specifically, replay data weightings are obtained via the probability density estimation from each mode. This is also beneficial in overcoming data imbalance among multiple modes and consolidating the significant features of past modes further. Alternatively, the proposed model also regularizes parameters based on its previous modes' importance, which is measured by synaptic intelligence (SI). Meanwhile, the objective is decoupled into a regularization-related part and a replay-related part, to overcome the potentially unstable optimization trajectory of SI-based continual learning. In comparison with several multimode monitoring methods, the effectiveness of the proposed MWCCA-A approach is demonstrated by a continuous stirred tank heater (CSTH), Tennessee Eastman process (TEP), and a practical coal pulverizing system.",

Furthermore, the manner in which consumers interact directly with health care AI is reshaping traditional physician-patient relationships. However, the academic community lacks a systematic comprehension of the research overview for such apps. OBJECTIVE: This paper systematically delineated and analyzed the characteristics of included studies, identified existing barriers and design recommendations for DTC health care AI apps mentioned in the literature and also provided a reference for future design and development. METHODS: This scoping review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews guidelines and was conducted according to Arksey and O'Malley's 5-stage framework. Peer-reviewed papers on DTC health care AI apps published until March 27, 2023, in Web of Science, Scopus, the ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, PubMed, and Google Scholar were included. The papers were analyzed using Braun and Clarke's reflective thematic analysis approach. RESULTS: Of the 2898 papers retrieved, 32 (1.1%) covering this emerging field were included. The included papers were recently published (2018-2023), and most (23/32, 72%) were from developed countries. The medical field was mostly general practice (8/32, 25%). In terms of users and functionalities, some apps were designed solely for single-consumer groups (24/32, 75%), offering disease diagnosis (14/32, 44%), health self-management (8/32, 25%), and health care information inquiry (4/32, 13%). Other apps connected to physicians (5/32, 16%), family members (1/32, 3%), nursing staff (1/32, 3%), and health care departments (2/32, 6%), generally to alert these groups to abnormal conditions of consumer users. In addition, 8 barriers and 6 design recommendations related to DTC health care AI apps were identified. Some more subtle obstacles that are particularly worth noting and corresponding design recommendations in consumer-facing health care AI systems, including enhancing human-centered explainability, establishing calibrated trust and addressing overtrust, demonstrating empathy in AI, improving the specialization of consumer-grade products, and expanding the diversity of the test population, were further discussed. CONCLUSIONS: The booming DTC health care AI apps present both risks and opportunities, which highlights the need to explore their current status. This paper systematically summarized and sorted the characteristics of the included studies, identified existing barriers faced by, and made future design recommendations for such apps. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically summarize and categorize academic research on these apps. Future studies conducting the design and development of such systems could refer to the results of this study, which is crucial to improve the health care services provided by DTC health care AI apps.",

This study proposes a U (2)-net-based phase-unwrapping model to explore the performance differences between the U (2)-net and U-net. To this end, first, the U-net, U (2)-net, and U (2)-net-lite models are trained simultaneously, then their prediction accuracy, noise resistance, generalization capability, and model weight size are compared. The results show that the U (2)-net model outperformed the U-net model. In particular, the U (2)-net-lite model achieved the same performance as that of the U (2)-net model while reducing the model weight size to 6.8% of the original U (2)-net model, thereby realizing a lightweight model.",

            "chunk": "OBJECTIVE: Observational studies had demonstrated a link between sleep disturbances and cognitive decline. Here, we aimed to investigate the causal association between genetically predicted sleep traits and cognitive impairment using Mendelian randomization (MR). METHODS: Using strict criteria, we selected genetic variants from European ancestry Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) from the Sleep Disorders Knowledge Portal and UK Biobank as instrumental variables for several sleep traits, including insomnia, sleep duration, daytime sleepiness, daytime napping, and chronotype. Summary statistics related to cognitive impairment were derived from five different GWAS, including the Social Science Genetic Association Consortium. The role of self-reported sleep trait phenotypes in the etiology of cognitive impairment was explored using inverse-variance weighted (IVW) tests, MR-Egger tests, and weighted medians, and sensitivity analyses were conducted to ensure robustness. RESULTS: In the main IVW analysis, sleep duration (reaction time: beta = -0.05, 95% CI -0.07 to -0.04, p = 1.93x10(-12) ), daytime sleepiness (average cortical thickness: beta = -0.12, 95% CI -0.22 to -0.02, p = 0.023), and daytime napping (fluid intelligence: beta = -0.47, 95% CI -0.87 to -0.07, p = 0.021; hippocampal volume in Alzheimer's disease: beta = -0.99, 95% CI -1.64 to -0.35, p = 0.002) were significantly negatively correlated with cognitive performance. However, any effects of insomnia and chronotype on cognitive impairment were not determined. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlighted that focusing on sleep behaviors or distinct sleep patterns-particularly sleep duration, daytime sleepiness, and daytime napping, was a promising approach for preventing cognitive impairment. This study also shed light on risk factors for and potential early markers of cognitive impairment risk factors.",

It was hypothesized that this deep learning tool would be able to measure the PTS on a high volume of radiographs expeditiously and that these measurements would be similar to previously validated manual measurements. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study (diagnosis); Level of evidence, 2. METHODS: A deep learning U-Net model was developed on a cohort of 300 postoperative short-leg lateral radiographs from patients who underwent ACLR to segment the tibial shaft, tibial joint surface, and tibial tuberosity. The model was trained via a random split after an 80 to 20 train-validation scheme. Masks for training images were manually segmented, and the model was trained for 400 epochs. An image processing pipeline was then deployed to annotate and measure the PTS using the predicted segmentation masks. Finally, the performance of this combined pipeline was compared with human measurements performed by 2 study personnel using a previously validated manual technique for measuring the PTS on short-leg lateral radiographs on an independent test set consisting of both pre- and postoperative images. RESULTS: The U-Net semantic segmentation model achieved a mean Dice similarity coefficient of 0.885 on the validation cohort. The mean difference between the human-made and computer-vision measurements was 1.92 degrees  (sigma = 2.81 degrees  [P = .24]). Extreme disagreements between the human and machine measurements, as defined by >/=5 degrees differences, occurred <5% of the time. The model was incorporated into a web-based digital application front-end for demonstration purposes, which can measure a single uploaded image in Portable Network Graphics format in a mean time of 5 seconds. CONCLUSION: We developed an efficient and reliable deep learning computer vision algorithm to automate the PTS measurement on short-leg lateral knee radiographs. This tool, which demonstrated good agreement with human annotations, represents an effective clinical adjunct for measuring the PTS as part of the preoperative assessment of patients with ACL injuries.",

We sampled 90 healthy participants who provided self-reported trust in humans and AI and underwent brain structural magnetic resonance imaging assessment. We found that trust in humans, as measured by the trust facet of the personality inventory NEO-PI-R, and trust in AI products, as measured by items assessing attitudes toward AI and by a composite score based on items assessing trust toward products with in-built AI, were not significantly correlated. We also used a concomitant dimensional neuroimaging approach employing a data-driven source-based morphometry (SBM) analysis of gray-matter-density to investigate neurostructural associations with each trust domain. We found that trust in humans was negatively (and significantly) correlated with an SBM component encompassing striato-thalamic and prefrontal regions. We did not observe significant brain structural association with trust in AI. The present findings provide evidence that trust in humans and trust in AI seem to be dissociable constructs. While the personal disposition to trust in humans might be \"hardwired\" to the brain's neurostructural architecture (at least from an individual differences perspective), a corresponding significant link for the disposition to trust AI was not observed. These findings represent an initial step toward elucidating how different forms of trust might be processed on the behavioral and brain level.",

Data was collected from hospitals in the Middle Euphrates and Southern regions of Iraq, with 152 pregnant patients included in the study. Patients were categorized into mild and severe infection groups, and their serum samples were analyzed for mineral levels (magnesium, copper, calcium, sodium, potassium, zinc, selenium, and iron) and immune factors (IL-6, IL-8, IL-32, IL-10, IL-18, IL-37, IL-38, IL-36, and IL-1). The findings revealed significant associations between specific mineral levels, immune factors, and perinatal outcomes. Mineral levels such as magnesium (75.5% mild infection, 80.9% severe infection), copper (68.2% mild infection, 64.3% severe infection), calcium ion (81.8% mild infection, 76.2% severe infection), sodium (70.9% mild infection, 69.0% severe infection), potassium (72.7% mild infection, 71.4% severe infection), zinc (61.8% mild infection, 54.8% severe infection), selenium (78.2% mild infection, 82.9% severe infection), and iron (74.5% mild infection, 68.3% severe infection) showed varying percentages associated with mild and severe infections. Immune factors such as IL-6 (32% mild infection, 21% severe infection), IL-8 (15% mild infection, 7% severe infection), IL-32 (24% mild infection, 9% severe infection), IL-10 (7% mild infection, no severe infection), IL-18 (13% mild infection, 11% severe infection) demonstrated varying percentages associated with perinatal outcomes, while other interleukins showed no changes in severe infections. These results highlight the potential of AI in predicting outcomes for pregnant women with COVID-19, which could aid in improving their management and care. Further research and validation of predictive models are recommended to enhance accuracy and applicability.",

We review the application of recent advances, supported by the GMSI and MS-LINK() programs, in neuroimaging technology to quantify pathology related to central pathology and disease worsening, and potential for their translation into clinical practice/trials. GMSI-supported advances in neuroimaging methods and biomarkers include developments in magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, ocular imaging, and machine learning. However, longitudinal studies are required to facilitate translation of these measures to the clinic and to justify their inclusion as endpoints in clinical trials of new therapeutics for MS.

            "chunk": "The human factor plays a key role in the automotive field since most accidents are due to drivers' unsafe and risky behaviors. The industry is now pursuing two main solutions to deal with this concern: in the short term, there is the development of systems monitoring drivers' psychophysical states, such as inattention and fatigue, and in the medium-long term, there is the development of fully autonomous driving. This second solution is promoted by recent technological progress in terms of Artificial Intelligence and sensing systems aimed at making vehicles more and more accurately aware of their \"surroundings.\" However, even with an autonomous vehicle, the driver should be able to take control of the vehicle when needed, especially during the current transition from the lower (SAE < 3) to the highest level (SAE = 5) of autonomous driving. In this scenario, the vehicle has to be aware not only of its \"surroundings\" but also of the driver's psychophysical state, i.e., a user-centered Artificial Intelligence. The neurophysiological approach is one the most effective in detecting improper mental states. This is particularly true if considering that the more automatic the driving will be, the less available the vehicular data related to the driver's driving style. The present study aimed at employing a holistic approach, considering simultaneously several neurophysiological parameters, in particular, electroencephalographic, electrooculographic, photopletismographic, and electrodermal activity data to assess the driver's mental fatigue in real time and to detect the onset of fatigue increasing. This would ideally work as an information/trigger channel for the vehicle AI. In all, 26 professional drivers were engaged in a 45-min-lasting realistic driving task in simulated conditions, during which the previously listed biosignals were recorded. Behavioral (reaction times) and subjective measures were also collected to validate the experimental design and to support the neurophysiological results discussion. Results showed that the most sensitive and timely parameters were those related to brain activity. To a lesser extent, those related to ocular parameters were also sensitive to the onset of mental fatigue, but with a delayed effect. The other investigated parameters did not significantly change during the experimental session.",

However, current flexible wearable sensors have problems such as low accuracy, poor real-time performance, and poor stability in motion monitoring, which seriously hinder the better application of flexible wearable sensors and are not conducive to the collection and monitoring of motion signals. To this end, this paper designed a flexible wearable sensor motion monitoring system and tested its performance through the preparation and performance research of new functional polymer conjugated materials. The research results show that the motion monitoring system designed based on the new functional polymer conjugated material flexible wearable sensor has good monitoring accuracy and real-time performance. When the output data is 500 pieces, the running monitoring accuracy reaches 95.4%, and the monitoring feedback time is 0.321 s; the high jump movement monitoring accuracy rate reaches 97%, and the monitoring feedback time is 0.287 s; the long jump movement monitoring accuracy rate reaches 96%, and the monitoring feedback time is 0.296 s. This shows that the flexible wearable sensor motion monitoring system of this paper has better performance and can meet the current demand for accuracy and real-time motion monitoring.

            "chunk": "BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI)-based tools can reshape healthcare practice. This includes ChatGPT which is considered among the most popular AI-based conversational models. Nevertheless, the performance of different versions of ChatGPT needs further evaluation in different settings to assess its reliability and credibility in various healthcare-related tasks. Therefore, the current study aimed to assess the performance of the freely available ChatGPT-3.5 and the paid version ChatGPT-4 in 10 different diagnostic clinical microbiology case scenarios. METHODS: The current study followed the METRICS (Model, Evaluation, Timing/Transparency, Range/Randomization, Individual factors, Count, Specificity of the prompts/language) checklist for standardization of the design and reporting of AI-based studies in healthcare. The models tested on December 3, 2023 included ChatGPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4 and the evaluation of the ChatGPT-generated content was based on the CLEAR tool (Completeness, Lack of false information, Evidence support, Appropriateness, and Relevance) assessed on a 5-point Likert scale with a range of the CLEAR scores of 1-5. ChatGPT output was evaluated by two raters independently and the inter-rater agreement was based on the Cohen's kappa statistic. Ten diagnostic clinical microbiology laboratory case scenarios were created in the English language by three microbiologists at diverse levels of expertise following an internal discussion of common cases observed in Jordan. The range of topics included bacteriology, mycology, parasitology, and virology cases. Specific prompts were tailored based on the CLEAR tool and a new session was selected following prompting each case scenario. RESULTS: The Cohen's kappa values for the five CLEAR items were 0.351-0.737 for ChatGPT-3.5 and 0.294-0.701 for ChatGPT-4 indicating fair to good agreement and suitability for analysis. Based on the average CLEAR scores, ChatGPT-4 outperformed ChatGPT-3.5 (mean: 2.64+/-1.06 vs. 3.21+/-1.05, P=.012, t-test). The performance of each model varied based on the CLEAR items, with the lowest performance for the \"Relevance\" item (2.15+/-0.71 for ChatGPT-3.5 and 2.65+/-1.16 for ChatGPT-4). A statistically significant difference upon assessing the performance per each CLEAR item was only seen in ChatGPT-4 with the best performance in \"Completeness\", \"Lack of false information\", and \"Evidence support\" (P=0.043). The lowest level of performance for both models was observed with antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) queries while the highest level of performance was seen in bacterial and mycologic identification. CONCLUSIONS: Assessment of ChatGPT performance across different diagnostic clinical microbiology case scenarios showed that ChatGPT-4 outperformed ChatGPT-3.5. The performance of ChatGPT demonstrated noticeable variability depending on the specific topic evaluated. A primary shortcoming of both ChatGPT models was the tendency to generate irrelevant content lacking the needed focus. Although the overall ChatGPT performance in these diagnostic microbiology case scenarios might be described as \"above average\" at best, there remains a significant potential for improvement, considering the identified limitations and unsatisfactory results in a few cases.",

            "chunk": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) is an artificial intelligence (AI)-based language processing model using deep learning to create human-like text dialogue. It has been a popular source of information covering vast number of topics including medicine. Patient education in head and neck cancer (HNC) is crucial to enhance the understanding of patients about their medical condition, diagnosis, and treatment options. Therefore, this study aims to examine the accuracy and reliability of ChatGPT in answering questions regarding HNC. METHODS: 154 head and neck cancer-related questions were compiled from sources including professional societies, institutions, patient support groups, and social media. These questions were categorized into topics like basic knowledge, diagnosis, treatment, recovery, operative risks, complications, follow-up, and cancer prevention. ChatGPT was queried with each question, and two experienced head and neck surgeons assessed each response independently for accuracy and reproducibility. Responses were rated on a scale: (1) comprehensive/correct, (2) incomplete/partially correct, (3) a mix of accurate and inaccurate/misleading, and (4) completely inaccurate/irrelevant. Discrepancies in grading were resolved by a third reviewer. Reproducibility was evaluated by repeating questions and analyzing grading consistency. RESULTS: ChatGPT yielded \"comprehensive/correct\" responses to 133/154 (86.4%) of the questions whereas, rates of \"incomplete/partially correct\" and \"mixed with accurate and inaccurate data/misleading\" responses were 11% and 2.6%, respectively. There were no \"completely inaccurate/irrelevant\" responses. According to category, the model provided \"comprehensive/correct\" answers to 80.6% of questions regarding \"basic knowledge\", 92.6% related to \"diagnosis\", 88.9% related to \"treatment\", 80% related to \"recovery - operative risks - complications - follow-up\", 100% related to \"cancer prevention\" and 92.9% related to \"other\". There was not any significant difference between the categories regarding the grades of ChatGPT responses (p=0.88). The rate of reproducibility was 94.1% (145 of 154 questions). CONCLUSION: ChatGPT generated substantially accurate and reproducible information to diverse medical queries related to HNC. Despite its limitations, it can be a useful source of information for both patients and medical professionals. With further developments in the model, ChatGPT can also play a crucial role in clinical decision support to provide the clinicians with up-to-date information.",

            "chunk": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become ubiquitous in human society, and yet vast segments of the global population have no, little, or counterproductive information about AI. It is necessary to teach AI topics on a mass scale. While there is a rush to implement academic initiatives, scant attention has been paid to the unique challenges of teaching AI curricula to a global and culturally diverse audience with varying expectations of privacy, technological autonomy, risk preference, and knowledge sharing. Our study fills this void by focusing on AI elements in a new framework titled Culturally Adaptive Thinking in Education for AI (CATE-AI) to enable teaching AI concepts to culturally diverse learners. Failure to contextualize and sensitize AI education to culture and other categorical human-thought clusters, can lead to several undesirable effects including confusion, AI-phobia, cultural biases to AI, increased resistance toward AI technologies and AI education. We discuss and integrate human behavior theories, AI applications research, educational frameworks, and human centered AI principles to articulate CATE-AI. In the first part of this paper, we present the development a significantly enhanced version of CATE. In the second part, we explore textual data from AI related news articles to generate insights that lay the foundation for CATE-AI, and support our findings. The CATE-AI framework can help learners study artificial intelligence topics more effectively by serving as a basis for adapting and contextualizing AI to their sociocultural needs.",

The current knowledge of health profession students about AI programs has still not been assessed in Jordan and the West Bank of Palestine (WBP). AIM: This study aimed to assess students' awareness and practice of AI programs in medicine and pharmacy in Jordan and the WBP. METHODS: This study was in the form of an observational, cross-sectional survey. A questionnaire was electronically distributed among students of medicine and pharmacy at An-Najah National University (WBP), Al-Isra University (Jordan), and Al-Balqa Applied University (Jordan). The questionnaire consisted of three main categories: sociodemographic characteristics of the participants, practice of AI programs, and perceptions of AI programs, including ChatGPT. RESULTS: A total of 321 students responded to the distributed questionnaire, and 261 participants (81.3%) stated that they had heard about AI programs. In addition, 135 participants had used AI programs before (42.1%), while less than half the participants used them in their university studies (44.2%): for drug information (44.5%), homework (38.9%), and writing research articles (39.3%). There was significantly (48.3%, P<0.005) more conviction in the use of AI programs for writing research articles among pharmacy students from Palestine compared to Jordan. Lastly, there was significantly more (53.8%, P<0.05) AI program use among medicine students than pharmacy students. CONCLUSION: While most medicine and pharmacy students had heard about AI programs, only a small proportion of the participants had used them in their medical study. In addition, attitudes and practice related to AI programs in their education differs between medicine and pharmacy students and between WBP and Jordan.",

            "chunk": "BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer are the first and second causes of death in over 130 countries across the world. They are also among the top three causes in almost 180 countries worldwide. Cardiovascular complications are often noticed in cancer patients, with nearly 20% exhibiting cardiovascular comorbidities. Physical exercise may be helpful for cancer survivors and people living with cancer (PLWC), as it prevents relapses, CVD, and cardiotoxicity. Therefore, it is beneficial to recommend exercise as part of cardio-oncology preventive care. OBJECTIVE: With the progress of deep learning algorithms and the improvement of big data processing techniques, artificial intelligence (AI) has gradually become popular in the fields of medicine and healthcare. In the context of the shortage of medical resources in China, it is of great significance to adopt AI and machine learning methods for prescription recommendations. This study aims to develop an interpretable machine learning-based intelligent system of exercise prescription for cardio-oncology preventive care, and this paper presents the study protocol. METHODS: This will be a retrospective machine learning modeling cohort study with interventional methods (i.e., exercise prescription). We will recruit PLWC participants at baseline (from 1 January 2025 to 31 December 2026) and follow up over several years (from 1 January 2027 to 31 December 2028). Specifically, participants will be eligible if they are (1) PLWC in Stage I or cancer survivors from Stage I; (2) aged between 18 and 55 years; (3) interested in physical exercise for rehabilitation; (4) willing to wear smart sensors/watches; (5) assessed by doctors as suitable for exercise interventions. At baseline, clinical exercise physiologist certificated by the joint training program (from 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2024) of American College of Sports Medicine and Chinese Association of Sports Medicine will recommend exercise prescription to each participant. During the follow-up, effective exercise prescription will be determined by assessing the CVD status of the participants. EXPECTED OUTCOMES: This study aims to develop not only an interpretable machine learning model to recommend exercise prescription but also an intelligent system of exercise prescription for precision cardio-oncology preventive care. ETHICS: This study is approved by Human Experimental Ethics Inspection of Guangzhou Sport University. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: http://www.chictr.org.cn, identifier ChiCTR2300077887.",

            "chunk": "PURPOSE: Breast ultrasound suffers from low positive predictive value and specificity. Artificial intelligence (AI) proposes to improve accuracy, reduce false negatives, reduce inter- and intra-observer variability and decrease the rate of benign biopsies. Perpetuating racial/ethnic disparities in healthcare and patient outcome is a potential risk when incorporating AI-based models into clinical practice; therefore, it is necessary to validate its non-bias before clinical use. APPROACH: Our retrospective review assesses whether our AI decision support (DS) system demonstrates racial/ethnic bias by evaluating its performance on 1810 biopsy proven cases from nine breast imaging facilities within our health system from January 1, 2018 to October 28, 2021. Patient age, gender, race/ethnicity, AI DS output, and pathology results were obtained. RESULTS: Significant differences in breast pathology incidence were seen across different racial and ethnic groups. Stratified analysis showed that the difference in output by our AI DS system was due to underlying differences in pathology incidence for our specific cohort and did not demonstrate statistically significant bias in output among race/ethnic groups, suggesting similar effectiveness of our AI DS system among different races (p > 0.05 for all). CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows promise that an AI DS system may serve as a valuable second opinion in the detection of breast cancer on diagnostic ultrasound without significant racial or ethnic bias. AI tools are not meant to replace the radiologist, but rather to aid in screening and diagnosis without perpetuating racial/ethnic disparities.",

These tools can accurately predict the perioperative risk for adverse outcomes, the need for blood transfusion, and the risk of difficult intubation. Intraoperatively, AI models can assist with technical skill augmentation, patient monitoring, and management. Postoperatively, AI technology can aid in preventing complications and discharge planning. While further prospective validation is needed, these early applications demonstrate promise in every area of perioperative care. SUMMARY: The practice of anesthesiology is at a precipice fueled by technological innovation. The clinical AI implementation would enable personalized and safer patient care by offering actionable insights from the wealth of perioperative data.",

            "chunk": "The highly variable rate of decline in kidney function in patients with immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) provides a major clinical challenge. Predicting which patients will progress to kidney failure, and how quickly, is difficult. Multiple novel therapies are likely to be approved in the short-term, but clinicians lack the tools to identify patients most likely to benefit from specific treatments at the right time. Noninvasive and validated markers for selecting at-risk patients and longitudinal monitoring are urgently needed. This review summarizes what is known about demographic, clinical, and histopathologic prognostic markers in the clinician's toolkit, including the International IgAN Prediction Tool. We also briefly review what is known on these topics in children and adolescents with IgAN. Although helpful, currently used markers leave clinicians heavily reliant on histologic features from the diagnostic kidney biopsy and standard clinical data to guide treatment choice, and very few noninvasive markers reflect treatment efficacy over time. Novel prognostic and predictive markers are under clinical investigation, with considerable progress being made in markers of complement activation. Other areas of research are the interplay between gut microbiota and galactose-deficient IgA1 expression; microRNAs; imaging; artificial intelligence; and markers of fibrosis. Given the rate of therapeutic advancement, the remaining gaps in biomarker research need to be addressed. We finish by describing our route to clinical utility of predictive and prognostic markers in IgAN. This route will provide us with the chance to improve IgAN prognosis by using robust, clinically practical markers to inform patient care.",

ASCVD risk estimators such as the pooled cohort equations (PCE) facilitate risk stratification and primary prevention of ASCVD but their accuracy is still suboptimal. METHODS: Using deep electronic health record data from 7,116,209 patients seen at 70+ hospitals and clinics across 5 states in the USA, we developed an artificial intelligence-based electrocardiogram analysis tool (ECG-AI) to detect CAD and assessed the additive value of ECG-AI-based ASCVD risk stratification to the PCE. We created independent ECG-AI models using separate neural networks including subjects without known history of ASCVD, to identify coronary artery calcium (CAC) score >/=300 Agatston units by computed tomography, obstructive CAD by angiography or procedural intervention, and regional left ventricular akinesis in >/=1 segment by echocardiogram, as a reflection of possible prior myocardial infarction (MI). These were used to assess the utility of ECG-AI-based ASCVD risk stratification in a retrospective observational study consisting of patients with PCE scores and no prior ASCVD. The study period covered all available digitized EHR data, with the first available ECG in 1987 and the last in February 2023. FINDINGS: ECG-AI for identifying CAC >/=300, obstructive CAD, and regional akinesis achieved area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) values of 0.88, 0.85, and 0.94, respectively. An ensembled ECG-AI identified 3, 5, and 10-year risk for acute coronary events and mortality independently and additively to PCE. Hazard ratios for acute coronary events over 3-years in patients without ASCVD that tested positive on 1, 2, or 3 versus 0 disease-specific ECG-AI models at cohort entry were 2.41 (2.14-2.71), 4.23 (3.74-4.78), and 11.75 (10.2-13.52), respectively. Similar stratification was observed in cohorts stratified by PCE or age. INTERPRETATION: ECG-AI has potential to address unmet need for accessible risk stratification in patients in whom PCE under, over, or insufficiently estimates ASCVD risk, and in whom risk assessment over time periods shorter than 10 years is desired.

            "chunk": "BACKGROUND: Prognosis is crucial for personalized treatment and surveillance suggestion of the resected non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients in stage I-III. Although the tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging system is a powerful predictor, it is not perfect enough to accurately distinguish all the patients, especially within the same TNM stage. In this study, we developed an intelligent prognosis evaluation system (IPES) using pre-therapy CT images to assist the traditional TNM staging system for more accurate prognosis prediction of resected NSCLC patients. METHODS: 20,333 CT images of 6371 patients from June 12, 2009 to March 24, 2022 in West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Mianzhu People's Hospital, Peking University People's Hospital, Chengdu Shangjin Nanfu Hospital and Guangan Peoples' Hospital were included in this retrospective study. We developed the IPES based on self-supervised pre-training and multi-task learning, which aimed to predict an overall survival (OS) risk for each patient. We further evaluated the prognostic accuracy of the IPES and its ability to stratify NSCLC patients with the same TNM stage and with the same EGFR genotype. FINDINGS: The IPES was able to predict OS risk for stage I-III resected NSCLC patients in the training set (C-index 0.806; 95% CI: 0.744-0.846), internal validation set (0.783; 95% CI: 0.744-0.825) and external validation set (0.817; 95% CI: 0.786-0.849). In addition, IPES performed well in early-stage (stage I) and EGFR genotype prediction. Furthermore, by adopting IPES-based survival score (IPES-score), resected NSCLC patients in the same stage or with the same EGFR genotype could be divided into low- and high-risk subgroups with good and poor prognosis, respectively (p < 0.05 for all). INTERPRETATION: The IPES provided a non-invasive way to obtain prognosis-related information from patients. The identification of IPES for resected NSCLC patients with low and high prognostic risk in the same TNM stage or with the same EGFR genotype suggests that IPES have potential to offer more personalized treatment and surveillance suggestion for NSCLC patients.

Such data is ripe for use with predictive analytics such as artificial intelligence (AI) methods, which require large datasets. To address this unmet need, we provide a multi-institutional, large-scale pediatric dataset of 23,101 multi-parametric MRI exams acquired through routine care for 1,526 brain tumor patients, as part of the Children's Brain Tumor Network. This includes longitudinal MRIs across various cancer diagnoses, with associated patient-level clinical information, digital pathology slides, as well as tissue genotype and omics data. To facilitate downstream analysis, treatment-naive images for 370 subjects were processed and released through the NCI Childhood Cancer Data Initiative via the Cancer Data Service. Through ongoing efforts to continuously build these imaging repositories, our aim is to accelerate discovery and translational AI models with real-world data, to ultimately empower precision medicine for children.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Face photographs (frontal and lateral) of 15 patients with moderate to severe dentofacial deformity, taken before and after orthodontic-surgical correction, were selected and randomized between two different questionnaires. In addition, five patients without dentofacial deformity were used as controls in both questionnaires. These questionnaires were taken by adults responsible for hiring personnel to work in commerce and business activities, graduates or postgraduates in business administration, with experience in recruiting and hiring personnel. The evaluation took place using a Likert scale with values ranging from 0 to 10 (in which 0 corresponded to complete disagreement and 10 to complete agreement), considering the following variables in a first impression judgment: honesty, intelligence, productivity at work, and hiring chance. Data were tabulated and statistical analysis was performed using a linear regression model for the explanatory variables that showed statistical significance in the analysis of variance (ANOVA). Effect size through Cohen's d has been corrected for all comparisons performed. RESULTS: All re-examined domains demonstrated statistical differences even when included in a multivariate model (p < 0.05), with lower mean values for those requiring pre-treatment (presenting deformity), although the effect size was small for all comparisons. CONCLUSION: Dentofacial deformity influenced the hiring chance, although not appearing to be a preponderant factor for hiring, acting as a tiebreaker among the candidates adopted.",

Within computer games, users' evaluation of the narrative is influenced by their estimation of CAs' intelligence and believability. However, the impact of CAs' roles and communication styles on users' experience remains unclear. This research investigates such influence of CAs' roles and communication styles through a crime-solving textual game. Four different CAs were developed and each of them was assigned to a role of either witness or suspect and to a communication style than can be either aggressive or cooperative. Communication styles were simulated through a Wizard of Oz method. Users' task was to interact, through real-time written exchanges, with the four CAs and then to identify the culprit, assess the certainty of their judgments, and rank the CAs based on their conversational preferences. In addition, users' experience was evaluated using perceptual measures (perceived intelligence and believability scales) and behavioral measures (including analysis of users' input length, input delay, and conversation length). The results revealed that users' evaluation of CAs' intelligence and believability was primarily influenced by CAs' roles. On the other hand, users' conversational behaviors were mainly influenced by CAs' communication styles. CAs' communication styles also significantly determined users' choice of the culprit and conversational preferences.",

The study aimed determine whether the iron deposition in the brains of people with Parkinson's disease (PD) is correlated with freezing of gait (FOG). METHODS: We retrospectively collected the data of 24 patients with PD from the Movement Disorders Program and 36 healthy controls (HCs) from January 2021 to December 2021. Clinical assessments included mental intelligence scales, Parkinson rating scales, motor-related scales, and clinical gait assessments. All exercise scales and gait assessments were performed in the \"ON\" and \"OFF\" states. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were collected using 3-dimensional fast low-angle shot sequences. We chose the bilateral red nucleus, substantia nigra, thalamus, putamen, caudate nucleus, and globus pallidus as regions of interest for QSM analysis. RESULTS: The iron deposition in the substantia nigra of the PD group was significantly higher than that of the HC group (P<0.01). In the PD group, the iron deposition in the substantia nigra of patients with FOG was significantly higher than that in patients without FOG (P=0.04). The iron deposition in the substantia nigra was positively correlated with the New Freezing of Gait Questionnaire (P=0.03). The scores for depression and anxiety of the PD group were significantly higher than those of the HC group, while the Berg balance scale score was significantly lower (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The iron deposition in the substantia nigra of patients with PD is increased compared with that of controls and is associated with FOG. QSM can be used to detect brain iron deposition in patients with PD, which would help to explore the mechanism of abnormal neurobiological activity in FOG.",

            "chunk": "BACKGROUND: Pericoronary artery coronary tissue (PACT) is a type of epicardial fat that can reflect the state of the coronary artery (inflammation, etc.). However, it cannot be reasonably and efficiently utilized in routine computed tomography (CT) examination. The aim of this study was to use artificial intelligence (AI) software to analyze coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) and measure the coronary perivascular fat attenuation index (FAI) of patients. The relationship between FAI and the occurrence of coronary adverse events and the degree of coronary stenosis were further analyzed. METHODS: This study involved patients who experienced CCTA in West China Hospital, Sichuan University, from January 2012 to December 2012. These patients were followed up to 2020 and classified according to the occurrence of coronary adverse events and the degree of stenosis of the lumen. For all patients, AI software was used to analyze the CCTA images of patients, and the FAI of 3 coronary arteries, the left anterior descending artery (LAD), the left circumflex artery (LCX), and the right coronary artery (RCA), was measured. Moreover, the relationship between FAI and patients with different degrees of coronary stenosis and adverse coronary events was determined. RESULTS: Comparisons between any 2 groups showed that the differences in the FAI among the 4 groups for the LAD were significant (all P values <0.05). There were no significant differences between the group with less-than-moderate stenosis (Mb) without adverse events and the group with moderate-or-above stenosis (M) with no adverse events for the LCX (P>0.05). For the remaining groups, FAI values exhibited statistically significant differences (P<0.05). According to the degree of lumen stenosis, the patients were divided into groups according to LAD, LCX, and RCA and the sum of the 3 vessels. There were significant differences in coronary FAI among the groups with different degrees of lumen stenosis for the sum of the 3 vessels, the LAD, and the LCX (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: FAI can reflect the state of the coronary artery, which is related to inflammation of the coronary lumen. Moreover, there is a relationship between FAI and the degree of stenosis in the coronary lumen: the narrower the coronary lumen is, the higher the FAI around the lumen.",

The recent breakthrough in artificial intelligence has made it possible to predict protein-protein interactions and model their structures. Unfortunately, detecting antigen-binding sites associated with a specific antibody is still a challenging problem. To tackle this challenge, we implemented a deep learning model to characterize interaction patterns between antibodies and their corresponding antigens. With high accuracy, our model can distinguish between antibody-antigen complexes and other types of protein-protein complexes. More intriguingly, we can identify antigens from other common protein binding regions with an accuracy of higher than 70% even if we only have the epitope information. This indicates that antigens have distinct features on their surface that antibodies can recognize. Additionally, our model was unable to predict the partnerships between antibodies and their particular antigens. This result suggests that one antigen may be targeted by more than one antibody and that antibodies may bind to previously unidentified proteins. Taken together, our results support the precision of antibody-antigen interactions while also suggesting positive future progress in the prediction of specific pairing.",

This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the faithfulness problem in existing research on AI in healthcare and medicine, with a focus on the analysis of the causes of unfaithful results, evaluation metrics, and mitigation methods. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using PRISMA methodology, we sourced 5,061 records from five databases (PubMed, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, Google Scholar) published between January 2018 to March 2023. We removed duplicates and screened records based on exclusion criteria. RESULTS: With 40 leaving articles, we conducted a systematic review of recent developments aimed at optimizing and evaluating factuality across a variety of generative medical AI approaches. These include knowledge-grounded LLMs, text-to-text generation, multimodality-to-text generation, and automatic medical fact-checking tasks. DISCUSSION: Current research investigating the factuality problem in medical AI is in its early stages. There are significant challenges related to data resources, backbone models, mitigation methods, and evaluation metrics. Promising opportunities exist for novel faithful medical AI research involving the adaptation of LLMs and prompt engineering. CONCLUSION: This comprehensive review highlights the need for further research to address the issues of reliability and factuality in medical AI, serving as both a reference and inspiration for future research into the safe, ethical use of AI in medicine and healthcare.",

            "chunk": "BACKGROUND: A range of rare mutations involving micro-deletion or -duplication of genetic material (copy number variants (CNVs)) have been associated with high neurodevelopmental and psychiatric risk (ND-CNVs). Irritability is frequently observed in childhood neurodevelopmental conditions, yet its aetiology is largely unknown. Genetic variation may play a role, but there is a sparsity of studies investigating presentation of irritability in young people with ND-CNVs. AIMS: This study aimed to investigate whether there is a difference in irritability in young people with rare ND-CNVs compared to those without ND-CNVs, and to what extent irritability is associated with psychiatric diagnoses and cognitive ability (IQ). METHODS: Irritability and broader psychopathology was assessed in 485 young people with ND-CNVs and 164 sibling controls, using the child and adolescent psychiatric assessment (CAPA). Autism was assessed using the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ), and Intelligence Quotient (IQ) by the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI). RESULTS: 54% of young people with ND-CNVs met the threshold for irritability; significantly more than controls (OR = 3.77, CI = 3.07-7.90, p= 5.31 x 10(-11)). When controlling for the presence of other psychiatric comorbidities, ND-CNV status was still associated with irritability. There was no evidence for a relationship between irritability and IQ. CONCLUSIONS: Irritability is an important aspect of the clinical picture in young people with ND-CNVs. This work shows that genetic variation is associated with irritability in young people with ND-CNVs, independent of psychiatric comorbidities or IQ impairment. Clinicians should be aware of this increased risk to inform management and interventions.",

            "chunk": "RATIONALE: Skeletal muscle fat infiltration progresses with aging and is worsened among individuals with a history of cigarette smoking. Many negative impacts of smoking on muscles are likely reversible with smoking cessation. OBJECTIVES: To determine if the progression of skeletal muscle fat infiltration with aging is altered by smoking cessation among lung cancer screening participants. METHODS: This was a secondary analysis based on the National Lung Screening Trial. Skeletal muscle attenuation in Hounsfield unit (HU) was derived from the baseline and follow-up low-dose CT scans using a previously validated artificial intelligence algorithm. Lower attenuation indicates greater fatty infiltration. Linear mixed-effects models were constructed to evaluate the associations between smoking status and the muscle attenuation trajectory. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 19,019 included participants (age: 61 years, 5 [SD]; 11,290 males), 8,971 (47.2%) were actively smoking cigarettes. Accounting for body mass index, pack-years, percent emphysema, and other confounding factors, actively smoking predicted a lower attenuation in both males (beta(0) =-0.88 HU, P<.001) and females (beta(0) =-0.69 HU, P<.001), and an accelerated muscle attenuation decline-rate in males (beta(1)=-0.08 HU/y, P<.05). Age-stratified analyses indicated that the accelerated muscle attenuation decline associated with smoking likely occurred at younger age, especially in females. CONCLUSIONS: Among lung cancer screening participants, active cigarette smoking was associated with greater skeletal muscle fat infiltration in both males and females, and accelerated muscle adipose accumulation rate in males. These findings support the important role of smoking cessation in preserving muscle health.",

            "chunk": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Pain is a challenging multifaceted symptom reported by most cancer patients, resulting in a substantial burden on both patients and healthcare systems. This systematic review aims to explore applications of artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) in predicting pain-related outcomes and supporting decision-making processes in pain management in cancer. METHODS: A comprehensive search of Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE and Web of Science databases was conducted using terms including \"Cancer\", \"Pain\", \"Pain Management\", \"Analgesics\", \"Opioids\", \"Artificial Intelligence\", \"Machine Learning\", \"Deep Learning\", and \"Neural Networks\" published up to September 7, 2023. The screening process was performed using the Covidence screening tool. Only original studies conducted in human cohorts were included. AI/ML models, their validation and performance and adherence to TRIPOD guidelines were summarized from the final included studies. RESULTS: This systematic review included 44 studies from 2006-2023. Most studies were prospective and uni-institutional. There was an increase in the trend of AI/ML studies in cancer pain in the last 4 years. Nineteen studies used AI/ML for classifying cancer patients' pain development after cancer therapy, with median AUC 0.80 (range 0.76-0.94). Eighteen studies focused on cancer pain research with median AUC 0.86 (range 0.50-0.99), and 7 focused on applying AI/ML for cancer pain management decisions with median AUC 0.71 (range 0.47-0.89). Multiple ML models were investigated with. median AUC across all models in all studies (0.77). Random forest models demonstrated the highest performance (median AUC 0.81), lasso models had the highest median sensitivity (1), while Support Vector Machine had the highest median specificity (0.74). Overall adherence of included studies to TRIPOD guidelines was 70.7%. Lack of external validation (14%) and clinical application (23%) of most included studies was detected. Reporting of model calibration was also missing in the majority of studies (5%). CONCLUSION: Implementation of various novel AI/ML tools promises significant advances in the classification, risk stratification, and management decisions for cancer pain. These advanced tools will integrate big health-related data for personalized pain management in cancer patients. Further research focusing on model calibration and rigorous external clinical validation in real healthcare settings is imperative for ensuring its practical and reliable application in clinical practice.",

            "chunk": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is a rare but lethal cancer. Recent evidence reveals that pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasms (PanINs), the microscopic precursor lesions in the pancreatic ducts that can give rise to invasive pancreatic cancer, are significantly larger and more prevalent than previously believed. Better understanding of the growth law dynamics of PanINs may improve our ability to understand how a miniscule fraction of these lesions makes the transition to invasive cancer. Here, using artificial intelligence (AI)-based three-dimensional (3D) tissue mapping method, we measured the volumes of >1,000 PanIN and found that lesion size is distributed according to a power law with a fitted exponent of -1.7 over > 3 orders of magnitude. Our data also suggest that PanIN growth is not very sensitive to the pancreatic microenvironment or an individual's age, family history, and lifestyle, and is rather shaped by general growth behavior. We analyze several models of PanIN growth and fit the predicted size distributions to the observed data. The best fitting models suggest that both intraductal spread of PanIN lesions and fusing of multiple lesions into large, highly branched structures drive PanIN growth patterns. This work lays the groundwork for future mathematical modeling efforts integrating PanIN incidence, morphology, genomic, and transcriptomic features to understand pancreas tumorigenesis, and demonstrates the utility of combining experimental measurement of human tissues with dynamic modeling for understanding cancer tumorigenesis.",

Experimental methods to probe TCR-antigen interactions are slow, labor-intensive, costly, and yield moderate throughput. To address this problem, we developed pMTnet-omni, an Artificial Intelligence (AI) system based on hybrid protein sequence and structure information, to predict the pairing of TCRs of alphabeta T cells with peptide-MHC complexes (pMHCs). pMTnet-omni is capable of handling peptides presented by both class I and II pMHCs, and capable of handling both human and mouse TCR-pMHC pairs, through information sharing enabled this hybrid design. pMTnet-omni achieves a high overall Area Under the Curve of Receiver Operator Characteristics (AUROC) of 0.888, which surpasses competing tools by a large margin. We showed that pMTnet-omni can distinguish binding affinity of TCRs with similar sequences. Across a range of datasets from various biological contexts, pMTnet-omni characterized the longitudinal evolution and spatial heterogeneity of TCR-pMHC interactions and their functional impact. We successfully developed a biomarker based on pMTnet-omni for predicting immune-related adverse events of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment in a cohort of 57 ICI-treated patients. pMTnet-omni represents a major advance towards developing a clinically usable AI system for TCR-pMHC pairing prediction that can aid the design and implementation of TCR-based immunotherapeutics.",

Integration of advanced data analytics in Quantitative Pharmacology is crucial for drug-disease knowledge management, enabling precise, efficient and inclusive drug development and utilization - an application we refer to as model-informed precision medicine. AI/ML enables characterization of the molecular and clinical sources of heterogeneity in disease trajectory, advancing end point qualification and biomarker discovery, and informing patient enrichment for proof-of-concept studies as well as trial designs for efficient evidence generation incorporating digital twins and virtual control arms. Explainable ML methods are valuable in elucidating predictors of efficacy and safety of pharmacological treatments, thereby informing response monitoring and risk mitigation strategies. In oncology, emerging opportunities exist for development of the next generation of disease models via ML-assisted joint longitudinal modeling of high-dimensional biomarker data such as circulating tumor DNA and radiomics profiles as predictors of survival outcomes. Finally, mining real-world data leveraging ML algorithms enables understanding of the impact of exclusion criteria on clinical outcomes, thereby informing rational design of appropriately inclusive clinical trials through data-driven broadening of eligibility criteria.

Regulatory agencies recommend in vivo skin adhesion studies to support the approval of TDS in both new drug applications and abbreviated new drug applications. The current assessment approach in such studies is based on the visual observation of the percent adhesion, defined as the ratio of the area of TDS attached to the skin to the total area of the TDS. Visually estimated percent adhesion by trained clinicians or trial participants creates variability and bias. In addition, trial participants are typically confined to clinical centers during the entire product wear period, which may lead to challenges when translating adhesion performance to the real world setting. In this work we propose to use artificial intelligence and mobile technologies to aid and automate the collection of photographic evidence and estimation of percent adhesion.

Hence, developing a web system for nurses may help improve the quality of visiting health services for community-dwelling frail older adults. This study was conducted to develop a web application that reflects the needs of visiting nurses. METHODS: Visiting nurses of public health centers and community centers in South Korea participated in the design and evaluation process. Six nurses took part in the focus group interviews, and 21 visiting nurses and community center managers participated in the satisfaction evaluation. Focus group interviews were conducted to identify the needs of visiting nurses with respect to system function. Based on the findings, a web application that can support the effective delivery of home visiting services in the community was developed. An artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm was also developed to recommend health and welfare services according to each patient's health status. After development, a structured survey was conducted to evaluate user satisfaction with system features using Kano's model. RESULTS: The new system can be used with mobile devices to increase the mobility of visiting nurses. The system includes 13 features that support the management of patient data and enhance the efficiency of visiting services (e.g., map, navigation, scheduler, protocol archives, professional advice, and online case conferencing). The user satisfaction survey revealed that nurses showed high satisfaction with the system. Among all features, the nurses were most satisfied with the care plan, which included AI-based recommendations for community referral. CONCLUSIONS: The system developed from the study has attractive features for visiting nurses and supports their essential tasks. The system can help with effective case management for older adults requiring in-home care and reduce nurses' workload. It can also improve communication and networking between healthcare and long-term care institutions.",

            "chunk": "In the ideal world prognostication or predicting disease course in any chronic condition would allow the clinician to anticipate disease behaviour, providing crucial information for the patient and data regarding best use of resources. Prognostication also allows an understanding of likely response to treatment and the risk of adverse effects of a treatment leading to withdrawal in any individual patient. Therefore, the ability to predict outcomes from the onset of disease is the key step to developing precision personalised medicine, which is the design of medical care to optimise efficiency or therapeutic benefit based on careful profiling of patients. An important corollary is to prevent unnecessary healthcare costs. This paper outlines currently available predictors of disease outcome in IBD and looks to the future which will involve the use of artificial intelligence to interrogate big data derived from various important 'omes' to tease out a more holistic approach to IBD.",

Even if milestones have been recently reached in understanding and managing end-stage liver disease (ESLD), the disease course remains somewhat difficult to prognosticate. These difficulties have already been acknowledged already in the past, when scores instead of single parameters have been proposed as valuable tools for short-term prognosis. These standard scores, like Child Turcotte Pugh (CTP) and model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score, relying on biochemical and clinical parameters, are still widely used in clinical practice to predict short- and medium-term prognosis. The MELD score, which remains an accurate, easy-to-use, objective predictive score, has received significant modifications over time, in order to improve its performance especially in the liver transplant (LT) setting, where it is widely used as prioritization tool. Although many attempts to improve prognostic accuracy have failed because of lack of replicability or poor benefit with the comparator (often the MELD score or its variants), few scores have been recently proposed and validated especially for subgroups of patients with ESLD, as those with acute-on-chronic liver failure. Artificial intelligence will probably help hepatologists in the near future to fill the current gaps in predicting disease course and long-term prognosis of such patients.",

            "chunk": "The meaning of most words in language depends on their context. Understanding how the human brain extracts contextualized meaning, and identifying where in the brain this takes place, remain important scientific challenges. But technological and computational advances in neuroscience and artificial intelligence now provide unprecedented opportunities to study the human brain in action as language is read and understood. Recent contextualized language models seem to be able to capture homonymic meaning variation (\"bat\", in a baseball vs. a vampire context), as well as more nuanced differences of meaning-for example, polysemous words such as \"book\", which can be interpreted in distinct but related senses (\"explain a book\", information, vs. \"open a book\", object) whose differences are fine-grained. We study these subtle differences in lexical meaning along the concrete/abstract dimension, as they are triggered by verb-noun semantic composition. We analyze functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activations elicited by Italian verb phrases containing nouns whose interpretation is affected by the verb to different degrees. By using a contextualized language model and human concreteness ratings, we shed light on where in the brain such fine-grained meaning variation takes place and how it is coded. Our results show that phrase concreteness judgments and the contextualized model can predict BOLD activation associated with semantic composition within the language network. Importantly, representations derived from a complex, nonlinear composition process consistently outperform simpler composition approaches. This is compatible with a holistic view of semantic composition in the brain, where semantic representations are modified by the process of composition itself. When looking at individual brain areas, we find that encoding performance is statistically significant, although with differing patterns of results, suggesting differential involvement, in the posterior superior temporal sulcus, inferior frontal gyrus and anterior temporal lobe, and in motor areas previously associated with processing of concreteness/abstractness.",

In this communication, we first discuss the goals of precision medicine, and contextualize the use of AI in precision medicine by showcasing innovative applications (e.g., prediction of tumor growth and overall survival, biomarker identification using biomedical images, and identification of patient population for clinical practice) which were presented during the February 2023 virtual public workshop entitled \"Application of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning for Precision Medicine,\" hosted by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and University of Maryland Center of Excellence in Regulatory Science and Innovation (M-CERSI). Next, we put forward challenges brought about by the multidisciplinary nature of AI, particularly highlighting the need for AI to be trustworthy. To address such challenges, we subsequently note practical approaches, viz., differential privacy, synthetic data generation, and federated learning. The proposed strategies - some of which are highlighted presentations from the workshop - are for the protection of personal information and intellectual property. In addition, methods such as the risk-based management approach and the need for an agile regulatory ecosystem are discussed. Finally, we lay out a call for action that includes sharing of data and algorithms, development of regulatory guidance documents, and pooling of expertise from a broad-spectrum of stakeholders to enhance the application of AI in precision medicine.",

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a novel approach that makes collecting and analyzing data in complex systems more accessible. This study highlights recent research on AI's application and capabilities in health policymaking. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Scopus, and the Web of Science databases to find relevant studies from 2000 to 2023, using the keywords \"artificial intelligence\" and \"policymaking.\" We used Walt and Gilson's policy triangle framework for charting the data. RESULTS: The results revealed that using AI in health policy paved the way for novel analyses and innovative solutions for intelligent decision-making and data collection, potentially enhancing policymaking capacities, particularly in the evaluation phase. It can also be employed to create innovative agendas with fewer political constraints and greater rationality, resulting in evidence-based policies. By creating new platforms and toolkits, AI also offers the chance to make judgments based on solid facts. The majority of the proposed AI solutions for health policy aim to improve decision-making rather than replace experts. CONCLUSION: Numerous approaches exist for AI to influence the health policymaking process. Health systems can benefit from AI's potential to foster the meaningful use of evidence-based policymaking.",

With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence(AI) technologies, traditional methods relying on tooth development, while reliable, can be enhanced by leveraging deep learning, particularly neural networks. This study evaluated the efficiency of an AI model by applying the entire panoramic image for age estimation. The outcome performances were analyzed through supervised learning (SL) models. METHODS: Total of 27,877 dental panorama images from 5 to 90 years of age were classified by 2 types of grouping. In type 1 they were classified by each age and in type 2, applying heuristic grouping, the age over 20 years were classified by every 5 years. Wide ResNet (WRN) and DenseNet (DN) were used for supervised learning. In addition, the analysis with +/- 3 years of deviation in both types were performed. RESULTS: For the DN model, while the type 1 grouping achieved an accuracy of 0.1016 and F1 score of 0.058, the type 2 achieved an accuracy of 0.3146 and F1 score of 0.2027. Incorporating +/- 3years of deviation, the accuracy of type 1 and 2 were 0.281, 0.7323 respectively; and the F1 score were 0.1768, 0.6583 respectively. For the WRN model, while the type 1 grouping achieved an accuracy of 0.1041 and F1 score of 0.0599, the type 2 achieved an accuracy of 0.3182 and F1 score of 0.2071. Incorporating +/- 3years of deviation, the accuracy of type 1 and 2 were 0.2716, 0.7323 respectively; and the F1 score were 0.1709, 0.6437 respectively.

            "chunk-id": 1,
            "chunk": "Background: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive, age-related interstitial lung disease (ILD) with limited therapeutic options. Despite the wide variety of different in vivo models for IPF, these preclinical models have shown limitations that may significantly impair their translational potential. Among the most relevant limitations are the methodologies used to assess the efficacy of anti-fibrotic treatments, that are not the ones used in humans. In this scenario, the goal of the work presented in this paper is to provide translational relevance to the bleomycin (BLM)-induced pulmonary fibrosis mouse model, introducing and validating novel readouts to evaluate the efficacy of treatments for IPF. Methods: The BLM model was optimized by introducing the use of functional assessments such as the Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) and the Diffusion Factor for Carbon Monoxide (DFCO), that are respectively the primary and secondary endpoints in clinical trials for IPF, comparing them to more common readouts such as lung histology, improved by the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to detect and quantify fibrotic tissue deposition, and metalloproitenase-7 (MMP-7), a clinical prognostic biomarker. Results: Lung function measurement and DFCO changes well correlated with Ashcroft score, the current gold-standard for the assessment of pulmonary fibrosis in mice. The relevance and robustness of these novel readouts in the BLM model was confirmed by the results obtained testing Nintedanib and Pirfenidone, the only drugs approved for the treatment of IPF patients: in fact, both drugs administered therapeutically, significantly affected the changes in these parameters induced by BLM treatment, with results that closely reflected the efficacy observed in the clinic. Changes in biomarkers such as MMP-7 were also evaluated, and well correlated with the modifications of FVC and DFCO. Conclusion: Novel functional readouts such as FVC and DFCO can be efficiently used to assess pathology progression in the BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis mouse model as well as compound efficacy, substantially improving its translational and predictivity potential.",

            "chunk": "BACKGROUND: Cannabis may offer therapeutic benefits to patients with advanced cancer not responding adequately to conventional palliative treatment. However, tolerability is a major concern. Cognitive function is a potential adverse reaction to tetrahydrocannabinol containing regimens. The aim of this study was to test cognitive function in patients being prescribed dronabinol as an adjuvant palliative therapy. METHODS: Adult patients with advanced cancer and severe related pain refractory to conventional palliative treatment were included in this case-series study. Patients were examined at baseline in conjunction with initiation of dronabinol therapy and at a two-week follow-up using three selected Wechsler's adult intelligence scale III neurocognitive tests: Processing Speed Index (PSI), Perceptual Organization Index (POI), and Working Memory Index (WMI). Patients were also assessed using pain visual analog scale, Major Depression Inventory, and Brief Fatigue Inventory. RESULTS: Eight patients consented to take part in the study. Two patients discontinued dronabinol therapy, one due to a complaint of dizziness and another critical progression of cancer disease, respectively. The remaining six patients were successfully treated with a daily dosage of 12.5 mg dronabinol (p = 0.039). PSI (p = 0.020), POI (p = 0.034.), and WMI (p = 0.039). CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive function improved in this group of patients with advanced cancer in conjunction with low-dose dronabinol therapy. The cause is likely multifactorial including reported relief of cancer-associated symptoms. Further clinical investigation is required.",

The first question we need to ask is how good humans are at recognizing deepfakes - the realistic-looking videos or images that show people doing or saying things that they never actually did or said generated by an artificial intelligence-based technology. Research has shown that an individual's self-efficacy correlates with their ability to detect deepfakes. Previous studies suggest that one of the most fundamental predictors of self-efficacy are personality traits. In this study, we ask the question: how can people's personality traits influence their efficacy in recognizing deepfakes? Methods: Predictive correlational design with a multiple linear regression data analysis technique was used in this study. The participants of this study were 200 Indonesian young adults. Results: The results showed that only traits of Honesty-humility and Agreeableness were able to predict the efficacy, in the negative and positive directions, respectively. Meanwhile, traits of Emotionality, Extraversion, Conscientiousness, and Openness cannot predict it. Conclusion: Self-efficacy in spotting deepfakes can be predicted by certain personality traits.",

AI-based contouring tools like Limbus are designed to delineate Organs at Risk (OAR) and Target Volumes quickly. This study evaluates the accuracy and efficiency of AI contouring compared to human radiation oncologists and the ability of professionals to differentiate between AI-generated and human-generated contours. Methods At a recent AI conference in Abu Dhabi, a blind comparative analysis was performed to assess AI's performance in radiation oncology. Participants included four human radiation oncologists and the Limbus(R) AI software. They contoured specific regions from CT scans of a breast cancer patient. The audience, consisting of healthcare professionals and AI experts, was challenged to identify the AI-generated contours. The exercise was repeated twice to observe any learning effects. Time taken for contouring and audience identification accuracy were recorded. Results Initially, only 28% of the audience correctly identified the AI contours, which slightly increased to 31% in the second attempt. This indicated a difficulty in distinguishing between AI and human expertise. The AI completed contouring in up to 60 seconds, significantly faster than the human average of 8 minutes. Discussion The results indicate that AI can perform radiation contouring comparably to human oncologists but much faster. The challenge faced by professionals in identifying AI versus human contours highlights AI's advanced capabilities in medical tasks. Conclusion AI shows promise in enhancing radiation oncology workflow by reducing contouring time without quality compromise. Further research is needed to confirm AI contouring's clinical efficacy and its integration into routine practice.",

            "chunk": "The efficacy of antibiotics and other antimicrobial agents in combating bacterial infections faces a grave peril in the form of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), an exceedingly pressing global health issue. The emergence and dissemination of drug-resistant bacteria can be attributed to the rampant overuse and misuse of antibiotics, leading to dire consequences such as organ failure and sepsis. Beyond the realm of individual health, the pervasive specter of AMR casts its ominous shadow upon the economy and society at large, resulting in protracted hospital stays, elevated medical expenditures, and diminished productivity, with particularly dire consequences for vulnerable populations. It is abundantly clear that addressing this ominous threat necessitates a concerted international endeavor encompassing the optimization of antibiotic deployment, the pursuit of novel antimicrobial compounds and therapeutic strategies, the enhancement of surveillance and monitoring of resistant bacterial strains, and the assurance of universal access to efficacious treatments. In the ongoing struggle against this encroaching menace, phage-based therapies, strategically tailored to combat AMR, offer a formidable line of defense. Furthermore, an alluring pathway forward for the development of vaccines lies in the utilization of virus-like particles (VLPs), which have demonstrated their remarkable capacity to elicit a robust immune response against bacterial infections. VLP-based vaccinations, characterized by their absence of genetic material and non-infectious nature, present a markedly safer and more stable alternative to conventional immunization protocols. Encouragingly, preclinical investigations have yielded promising results in the development of VLP vaccines targeting pivotal bacteria implicated in the AMR crisis, including Salmonella, Escherichia coli, and Clostridium difficile. Notwithstanding the undeniable potential of VLP vaccines, formidable challenges persist, including the identification of suitable bacterial markers for vaccination and the formidable prospect of bacterial pathogens evolving mechanisms to thwart the immune response. Nonetheless, the prospect of VLP-based vaccines holds great promise in the relentless fight against AMR, underscoring the need for sustained research and development endeavors. In the quest to marshal more potent defenses against AMR and to pave the way for visionary innovations, cutting-edge techniques that incorporate RNA interference, nanomedicine, and the integration of artificial intelligence are currently under rigorous scrutiny.",

Anti-quorum sensing agents (anti-QSA) is promising strategy to treat resistant infections, as well as reduce selective pressure that leads to antibiotic resistance of clinically relevant pathogens. This study analyzes the output, hotspots, and trends of research in the field of anti-QSA against clinically relevant pathogens. METHODS: The literature on anti-QSA from the Web of Science Core Collection database was retrieved and analyzed. Tools such as CiteSpace and Alluvial Generator were used to visualize and interpret the data. RESULTS: From 1998 to 2023, the number of publications related to anti-QAS research increased rapidly, with a total of 1,743 articles and reviews published in 558 journals. The United States was the largest contributor and the most influential country, with an H-index of 88, higher than other countries. Williams was the most productive author, and Hoiby N was the most cited author. Frontiers in Microbiology was the most prolific and the most cited journal. Burst detection indicated that the main frontier disciplines shifted from MICROBIOLOGY, CLINICAL, MOLECULAR BIOLOGY, and other biomedicine-related fields to FOOD, MATERIALS, NATURAL PRODUCTS, and MULTIDISCIPLINARY. In the whole research history, the strongest burst keyword was cystic-fibrosis patients, and the strongest burst reference was Lee and Zhang (2015). In the latest period (burst until 2023), the strongest burst keyword was silver nanoparticle, and the strongest burst reference was Whiteley et al. (2017). The co-citation network revealed that the most important interest and research direction was anti-biofilm/anti-virulence drug development, and timeline analysis suggested that this direction is also the most active. The key concepts alluvial flow visualization revealed seven terms with the longest time span and lasting until now, namely Escherichia coli, virulence, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, virulence factor, bacterial biofilm, gene expression, quorum sensing. Comprehensive analysis shows that nanomaterials, marine natural products, and artificial intelligence (AI) may become hotspots in the future. CONCLUSION: This bibliometric study reveals the current status and trends of anti-QSA research and may assist researchers in identifying hot topics and exploring new research directions.",

Therefore, it is necessary to deepen the understanding of related psychological factors in men and women. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether personality traits, emotional intelligence and negative affective are differentially related to physical exercise characteristics in men and women. METHOD: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 579 physically active people (61.1% men) between 18 and 59 years of age. The Big Five Inventory (BFI-15p), Brief Emotional Intelligence Scale (EQ-i-M20), and Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) were used. RESULTS: Compared with men, women exercised fewer days and minutes per week, had fewer years of participation and performed fewer different physical exercises. On the emotional intelligence scale, compared with men, women showed less stress management, adaptability and general mood but greater interpersonal intelligence. With regard to personality traits, compared with men, women showed greater openness, conscientiousness, agreeableness, and neuroticism. In males, heightened levels of general mood and extraversion were associated to a lasting commitment to physical exercise over time. Conversely, in females, depression was negatively associated with the years dedicated to physical exercise. CONCLUSION: Distinct approaches are essential for men and women, acknowledging the varied ways psychological factors are linked to physical exercise based on gender.",

Herein, an asymmetric gradient multilayer structured bacterial cellulose@Fe(3) O(4) /carbon nanotube/Ti(3) C(2) T(x) (BC@Fe(3) O(4) /CNT/Ti(3) C(2) T(x) ) multifunctional composite film is fabricated with simultaneously demonstrating fast Joule response, excellent EMI shielding effectiveness (EMI SE) and photothermal conversion properties. The asymmetric gradient 6-layer composite film with 40% of Ti(3) C(2) T(x) possesses excellent mechanical performance with exceptional tensile strength (76.1 MPa), large strain (14.7%), and good flexibility. This is attributed to the asymmetric gradient multilayer structure designed based on the hydrogen bonding self-assembly strategy between Ti(3) C(2) T(x) and BC. It achieved an EMI SE of up to 71.3 dB, which is attributed to the gradient \"absorption-reflection-reabsorption\" mechanism. Furthermore, this composite film also exhibits excellent low-voltage-driven Joule heating (up to 80.3  degrees C at 2.5 V within 15 s) and fast-response photothermal performance (up to 101.5  degrees C at 1.0 W cm(-2) within 10 s), which is attributed to the synergistic effect of heterostructure.

Also, although the structure of intelligence appeared to involve the same clusters of cognitive ability, relations between abilities were stronger in preterm children, implying that abilities are more differentiated in full-term than in preterm children. This commentary examined if these findings hold when different modelling methods are used. Instead of the network analysis used in the target article (Rapuc et al., 2023), I used confirmatory factor analysis and special forms of structural equation modelling designed to capture interactions between processes and their differentiation from general cognitive ability. I found, in line with the target article, that premature children scored lower overall in cognitive ability, and that cognitive processes are more strongly related in preterm than in full-term children. However, in contrast to the target article, specific abilities tended to differentiate with increasing general ability in preterm rather than in full-term children. In full-term children, increases in specific abilities were commensurate with increases in general ability. These differences may reflect slower development in preterm children and stronger dependence on executive processes dominating in preschool. Clinical implications are discussed.",

This study examined the Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices (KAP) of health professions' students in Jordan concerning AI, providing insights into their preparedness and perceptions. METHODS: An online questionnaire was distributed to 483 Jordanian health professions' students via social media. Demographic data, AI-related KAP, and barriers were collected. Quantile regression models analyzed associations between variables and KAP scores. RESULTS: Moderate AI knowledge was observed among participants, with specific understanding of data requirements and barriers. Attitudes varied, combining skepticism about AI replacing human teachers with recognition of its value. While AI tools were used for specific tasks, broader integration in medical education and practice was limited. Barriers included lack of knowledge, access, time constraints, and curriculum gaps. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the need to enhance medical education with AI topics and address barriers. Students need to be better prepared for AI integration, in order to enable medical education to harness AI's potential for improved patient care and training.",

            "chunk": "BACKGROUND: The accurate detection of variants is essential for genomics-based studies. Currently, there are various tools designed to detect genomic variants, however, it has always been a challenge to decide which tool to use, especially when various major genome projects have chosen to use different tools. Thus far, most of the existing tools were mainly developed to work on short-read data (i.e., Illumina); however, other sequencing technologies (e.g. PacBio, and Oxford Nanopore) have recently shown that they can also be used for variant calling. In addition, with the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI)-based variant calling tools, there is a pressing need to compare these tools in terms of efficiency, accuracy, computational power, and ease of use. RESULTS: In this study, we evaluated five of the most widely used conventional and AI-based variant calling tools (BCFTools, GATK4, Platypus, DNAscope, and DeepVariant) in terms of accuracy and computational cost using both short-read and long-read data derived from three different sequencing technologies (Illumina, PacBio HiFi, and ONT) for the same set of samples from the Genome In A Bottle project. The analysis showed that AI-based variant calling tools supersede conventional ones for calling SNVs and INDELs using both long and short reads in most aspects. In addition, we demonstrate the advantages and drawbacks of each tool while ranking them in each aspect of these comparisons. CONCLUSION: This study provides best practices for variant calling using AI-based and conventional variant callers with different types of sequencing data.",

However, it faces several significant challenges, including variable solar irradiance, temperature, and partial shading. Unfortunately, conventional Maximum Power Point Trackers (MPPTs) cannot accurately track partial shading. Artificial intelligence and optimization techniques have been proposed as alternatives, but they require extensive training and can take a long time to achieve maximum power point (MPP) under partial shading circumstances. In this paper, a dynamic and fast-moving method of MPP tracking is proposed for use under both uniform solar irradiance and partial shade. This method combines an enhanced incremental conductance (INC) algorithm with a global search algorithm that looks at how well solar cells work when partly shaded. Simulation investigations are performed to validate the method's applicability and ensure that it reaches the most accurate value of MPP with a short-tracking time of less than 0.2 s and a steady-state error of less than 0.3% of the PV power. The results confirm the efficacy of the suggested tracking method under uniform solar irradiance and partial shade.",

            "chunk": "Infectious keratitis (IK) is a major cause of corneal opacity. IK can be caused by a variety of microorganisms. Typically, fungal ulcers carry the worst prognosis. Fungal cases can be subdivided into filamentous and yeasts, which shows fundamental differences. Delays in diagnosis or initiation of treatment increase the risk of ocular complications. Currently, the diagnosis of IK is mainly based on slit-lamp examination and corneal scrapings. Notably, these diagnostic methods have their drawbacks, including experience-dependency, tissue damage, and time consumption. Artificial intelligence (AI) is designed to mimic and enhance human decision-making. An increasing number of studies have utilized AI in the diagnosis of IK. In this paper, we propose to use AI to diagnose IK (model 1), differentiate between bacterial keratitis and fungal keratitis (model 2), and discriminate the filamentous type from the yeast type of fungal cases (model 3). Overall, 9329 slit-lamp photographs gathered from 977 patients were enrolled in the study. The models exhibited remarkable accuracy, with model 1 achieving 99.3%, model 2 at 84%, and model 3 reaching 77.5%. In conclusion, our study offers valuable support in the early identification of potential fungal and bacterial keratitis cases and helps enable timely management.",

            "chunk-id": 1,
            "chunk": "OBJECTIVES: Scaphoid fractures are usually diagnosed using X-rays, a low-sensitivity modality. Artificial intelligence (AI) using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) has been explored for diagnosing scaphoid fractures in X-rays. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to evaluate the use of AI for detecting scaphoid fractures on X-rays and analyze its accuracy and usefulness. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study followed the guidelines of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) and PRISMA-Diagnostic Test Accuracy. A literature search was conducted in the PubMed database for original articles published until July 2023. The risk of bias and applicability were evaluated using the QUADAS-2 tool. A bivariate diagnostic random-effects meta-analysis was conducted, and the results were analyzed using the Summary Receiver Operating Characteristic (SROC) curve. RESULTS: Ten studies met the inclusion criteria and were all retrospective. The AI's diagnostic performance for detecting scaphoid fractures ranged from AUC 0.77 to 0.96. Seven studies were included in the meta-analysis, with a total of 3373 images. The meta-analysis pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.80 and 0.89, respectively. The meta-analysis overall AUC was 0.88. The QUADAS-2 tool found high risk of bias and concerns about applicability in 9 out of 10 studies. CONCLUSIONS: The current results of AI's diagnostic performance for detecting scaphoid fractures in X-rays show promise. The results show high overall sensitivity and specificity and a high SROC result. Further research is needed to compare AI's diagnostic performance to human diagnostic performance in a clinical setting. CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: Scaphoid fractures are prone to be missed secondary to assessment with a low sensitivity modality and a high occult fracture rate. AI systems can be beneficial for clinicians and radiologists to facilitate early diagnosis, and avoid missed injuries. KEY POINTS: * Scaphoid fractures are common and some can be easily missed in X-rays. * Artificial intelligence (AI) systems demonstrate high diagnostic performance for the diagnosis of scaphoid fractures in X-rays. * AI systems can be beneficial in diagnosing both obvious and occult scaphoid fractures.",

Novel cancer treatments, such as surgery and immunotherapy, are ineffective and expensive. In this situation, ion channels responsible for cell migration have appeared to be the most promising targets for cancer treatment. This research presents findings on the organic compounds present in Albizia lebbeck ethanolic extracts (ALEE), as well as their impact on the anti-migratory, anti-proliferative and cytotoxic potentials on MDA-MB 231 and MCF-7 human breast cancer cell lines. In addition, artificial intelligence (AI) based models, multilayer perceptron (MLP), extreme gradient boosting (XGB), and extreme learning machine (ELM) were performed to predict in vitro cancer cell migration on both cell lines, based on our experimental data. The organic compounds composition of the ALEE was studied using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. Cytotoxicity, anti-proliferations, and anti-migratory activity of the extract using Tryphan Blue, MTT, and Wound Heal assay, respectively. Among the various concentrations (2.5-200 mug/mL) of the ALEE that were used in our study, 2.5-10 mug/mL revealed anti-migratory potential with increased concentrations, and they did not show any effect on the proliferation of the cells (P < 0.05; n >/= 3). Furthermore, the three data-driven models, Multi-layer perceptron (MLP), Extreme gradient boosting (XGB), and Extreme learning machine (ELM), predict the potential migration ability of the extract on the treated cells based on our experimental data. Overall, the concentrations of the plant extract that do not affect the proliferation of the type cells used demonstrated promising effects in reducing cell migration. XGB outperformed the MLP and ELM models and increased their performance efficiency by up to 3% and 1% for MCF and 1% and 2% for MDA-MB231, respectively, in the testing phase.",

Multiple models were created with the AQ subscales ('Social skills,' 'Attention-shifting,' 'Attention to details,' 'Communication,' 'Imagination'), age, gender, the full-scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ), the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and the General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale added as the moderator variables. The GLM revealed that the AQ subscale 'Social skills' significantly predicted the RBMT-total scores with age, gender, and psychological measures scores as the moderator variables (Model 4: B=0.752, 95%CI: 0.191 to 1.313, p<0.01). Also, The GLM revealed that the AQ subscale 'Communication', in addition to 'Social skills', significantly predicted the RBMT- 'Prospective memory' (Model 4: B=0.298, 95%CI: 0.19 to 0.578, p<0.05).

            "chunk-id": 1,
            "chunk": "BACKGROUND: Primary care is known to be one of the most complex health care settings because of the high number of theoretically possible diagnoses. Therefore, the process of clinical decision-making in primary care includes complex analytical and nonanalytical factors such as gut feelings and dealing with uncertainties. Artificial intelligence is also mandated to offer support in finding valid diagnoses. Nevertheless, to translate some aspects of what occurs during a consultation into a machine-based diagnostic algorithm, the probabilities for the underlying diagnoses (odds ratios) need to be determined. OBJECTIVE: Cough is one of the most common reasons for a consultation in general practice, the core discipline in primary care. The aim of this scoping review was to identify the available data on cough as a predictor of various diagnoses encountered in general practice. In the context of an ongoing project, we reflect on this database as a possible basis for a machine-based diagnostic algorithm. Furthermore, we discuss the applicability of such an algorithm against the background of the specifics of general practice. METHODS: The PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases were searched with defined search terms, supplemented by the search for gray literature via the German Journal of Family Medicine until April 20, 2023. The inclusion criterion was the explicit analysis of cough as a predictor of any conceivable disease. Exclusion criteria were articles that did not provide original study results, articles in languages other than English or German, and articles that did not mention cough as a diagnostic predictor. RESULTS: In total, 1458 records were identified for screening, of which 35 articles met our inclusion criteria. Most of the results (11/35, 31%) were found for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The others were distributed among the diagnoses of asthma or unspecified obstructive airway disease, various infectious diseases, bronchogenic carcinoma, dyspepsia or gastroesophageal reflux disease, and adverse effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Positive odds ratios were found for cough as a predictor of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, influenza, COVID-19 infections, and bronchial carcinoma, whereas the results for cough as a predictor of asthma and other nonspecified obstructive airway diseases were inconsistent. CONCLUSIONS: Reliable data on cough as a predictor of various diagnoses encountered in general practice are scarce. The example of cough does not provide a sufficient database to contribute odds to a machine learning-based diagnostic algorithm in a meaningful way.",

            "chunk": "BACKGROUND: Poor medication adherence or inaccuracy in taking prescribed medications plays an important role in the recurrence or worsening of psychiatric symptoms in patients with schizophrenia, and the COVID-19 pandemic impacted their medication adherence with exacerbated symptoms or relapse. The use of mobile health services increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, and their role in improving mental health is becoming clearer. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the effectiveness of a smartphone app (MedAdhere) on medication adherence and accuracy among patients with schizophrenia and to measure their psychiatric symptoms and cognitive functions. METHODS: In this 12-week experimental study, participants were provided interventions with the MedAdhere app, and data were collected between June 2021 and September 2022. A total of 105 participants were randomly assigned to either the experimental or control groups. We used the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and Mini-Mental State Examination to measure the participants' psychiatric symptoms and cognitive functions. Generalized estimating equations were used for data analysis. RESULTS: A total of 94 participants met the inclusion criteria and completed the protocol, and the medication adherence rate of the experimental group was 94.72% (2785/2940) during the intervention. Psychotic symptoms (positive, negative, and general psychopathology symptoms) and cognitive functions (memory, language, and executive function) were significantly improved in the experimental group compared to the control group after the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: The MedAdhere app effectively and significantly improved medication adherence and, thereby, the psychiatric symptoms of patients with schizophrenia. This artificial intelligence assisted app could be extended to all patients who need to be reminded to take medication on schedule.

            "chunk-id": 1,
            "chunk": "BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic influenced many to consider methods to reduce human contact and ease the burden placed on health care workers. Conversational agents or chatbots are a set of technologies that may aid with these challenges. They may provide useful interactions for users, potentially reducing the health care worker burden while increasing user satisfaction. Research aims to understand these potential impacts of chatbots and conversational recommender systems and their associated design features. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate user perceptions of the helpfulness of an artificial intelligence chatbot that was offered free to the public in response to COVID-19. The chatbot engaged patients and provided educational information and the opportunity to report symptoms, understand personal risks, and receive referrals for care. METHODS: A cross-sectional study design was used to analyze 82,222 chats collected from patients in South Carolina seeking services from the Prisma Health system. Chi-square tests and multinomial logistic regression analyses were conducted to assess the relationship between reported risk factors and perceived chat helpfulness using chats started between April 24, 2020, and April 21, 2022. RESULTS: A total of 82,222 chat series were started with at least one question or response on record; 53,805 symptom checker questions with at least one COVID-19-related activity series were completed, with 5191 individuals clicking further to receive a virtual video visit and 2215 clicking further to make an appointment with a local physician. Patients who were aged >65 years (P<.001), reported comorbidities (P<.001), had been in contact with a person with COVID-19 in the last 14 days (P<.001), and responded to symptom checker questions that placed them at a higher risk of COVID-19 (P<.001) were 1.8 times more likely to report the chat as helpful than those who reported lower risk factors. Users who engaged with the chatbot to conduct a series of activities were more likely to find the chat helpful (P<.001), including seeking COVID-19 information (3.97-4.07 times), in-person appointments (2.46-1.99 times), telehealth appointments with a nearby provider (2.48-1.9 times), or vaccination (2.9-3.85 times) compared with those who did not perform any of these activities. CONCLUSIONS: Chatbots that are designed to target high-risk user groups and provide relevant actionable items may be perceived as a helpful approach to early contact with the health system for assessing communicable disease symptoms and follow-up care options at home before virtual or in-person contact with health care providers. The results identified and validated significant design factors for conversational recommender systems, including triangulating a high-risk target user population and providing relevant actionable items for users to choose from as part of user engagement.",

Artificial intelligence (AI) software may help detect data-related errors or facilitate process management. The aim of the present study was to test the extent to which the frequently encountered pre-analytical, analytical, and postanalytical errors in clinical laboratories, and likely clinical diagnoses can be detected through the use of a chatbot. METHODS: A total of 20 case scenarios, 20 multiple-choice, and 20 direct questions related to errors observed in pre-analytical, analytical, and postanalytical processes were developed in English. Difficulty assessment was performed for the 60 questions. Responses by 4 chatbots to the questions were scored in a blinded manner by 3 independent laboratory experts for accuracy, usefulness, and completeness. RESULTS: According to Chi-squared test, accuracy score of ChatGPT-3.5 (54.4\u202f%) was significantly lower than CopyAI (86.7\u202f%) (p=0.0269) and ChatGPT v4.0. (88.9\u202f%) (p=0.0168), respectively in cases. In direct questions, there was no significant difference between ChatGPT-3.5 (67.8\u202f%) and WriteSonic (69.4\u202f%), ChatGPT v4.0.

Here, this work develops a fully flexible, conformable, and functionalized multimodal HMI interface consisting of hydrogel-based sensors and a self-designed flexible printed circuit board. Thanks to the component regulation and structural design of the hydrogel, both electromyogram (EMG) and forcemyography (FMG) signals can be collected accurately and stably, so that they are later decoded with the assistance of artificial intelligence (AI). Compared with traditional multichannel EMG signals, the multimodal human-machine interaction method based on the combination of EMG and FMG signals significantly improves the efficiency of human-machine interaction by increasing the information entropy of the interaction signals. The decoding accuracy of the interaction signals from only two channels for different gestures reaches 91.28%. The resulting AI-powered active rehabilitation system can control a pneumatic robotic glove to assist stroke patients in completing movements according to the recognized human motion intention. Moreover, this HMI interface is further generalized and applied to other remote sensing platforms, such as manipulators, intelligent cars, and drones, paving the way for the design of future intelligent robot systems.",

The way teachers engage with their students not only impacts the learning outcomes but also contributes significantly to the overall classroom atmosphere. Understanding the underlying mechanisms that drive these relationships is crucial for educators and policymakers alike. This research seeks to shed light on these critical dynamics. METHODS: To investigate this multifaceted interplay, a participant pool of 369 Chinese English teachers was assembled. The research employed a comprehensive approach to data collection, utilizing self-report questionnaires completed by the instructors. Structural equation modeling, a robust statistical technique, was employed to rigorously analyze the collected data. RESULTS: The data analysis unveiled a robust and direct association between teacher mindfulness and the quality of teacher-student relationships. Beyond this primary link, a noteworthy revelation emerged: emotional intelligence, as measured through our analysis, was identified as a pivotal mediating factor in this relationship. This finding highlights the intricate web of emotions, awareness, and interpersonal interactions that underpin effective teaching and positive teacher-student relationships. DISCUSSION: These significant findings underscore the critical roles of teacher mindfulness and emotional intelligence in shaping the educational landscape.

AI can be used in all aspects of the bladder cancer field, including diagnosis, treatment and prognosis prediction. Nowadays, these technologies have an excellent medical auxiliary effect and are in explosive development, which has aroused the intense interest of researchers. This study will provide an in-depth analysis using bibliometric analysis to explore the trends in this field. METHOD: Documents regarding the application of AI in bladder cancer from 2000 to 2022 were searched and extracted from the Web of Science Core Collection. These publications were analyzed by bibliometric analysis software (CiteSpace, Vosviewer) to visualize the relationship between countries/regions, institutions, journals, authors, references, keywords. RESULTS: We analyzed a total of 2368 publications. Since 2016, the number of publications in the field of AI in bladder cancer has increased rapidly and reached a breathtaking annual growth rate of 43.98% in 2019. The U.S. has the largest research scale, the highest study level and the most significant financial support. The University of North Carolina is the institution with the highest level of research. EUROPEAN UROLOGY is the most influential journal with an impact factor of 24.267 and a total citation of 11,848. Wiklund P. has the highest number of publications, and Menon M. has the highest number of total citations. We also find hot research topics within the area through references and keywords analysis, which include two main parts: AI models for the diagnosis and prediction of bladder cancer and novel robotic-assisted surgery for bladder cancer radicalization and urinary diversion. CONCLUSION: AI application in bladder cancer is widely studied worldwide and has shown an explosive growth trend since the 21st century. AI-based diagnostic and predictive models will be the next protagonists in this field. Meanwhile, the robot-assisted surgery is still a hot topic and it is worth exploring the application of AI in it. The advancement and application of algorithms will be a massive driving force in this field.",

            "chunk": "At present, stroke remains the second highest cause of death globally and a leading cause of disability. From 1990 to 2019, the absolute number of strokes worldwide increased by 70.0%, and the prevalence of stroke increased by 85.0%, causing millions of deaths and disability. Ischemic stroke accounts for the majority of strokes, which is caused by arterial occlusion. Effective primary prevention strategies, early diagnosis, and timely interventions such as rapid reperfusion are in urgent implementation to control ischemic stroke. Otherwise, the stroke burden will probably continue to grow across the world as a result of population aging and an ongoing high prevalence of risk factors. To help with the diagnosis and management of ischemic stroke, newer techniques such as artificial intelligence (AI) are highly anticipated and may bring a new revolution. AI is a recent fast-growing research area which aims to mimic cognitive processes through a number of techniques such as machine learning (ML) methods of random forest learning (RFL) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). With the help of AI, several momentous milestones have already been attained across diverse dimensions of ischemic stroke. In the context of predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine (PPPM/3PM), we aim to transform stroke care from a reactive to a proactive and individualized paradigm. In this way, AI demonstrates strong clinical utility across all three levels of prevention in ischemic stroke. In this paper, we synoptically illustrated the history and current situation of AI and ML. Then, we summarized their clinical applications and efficacy in the management of stroke. We finally provided an outlook on how AI approaches might contribute to enhancing favorable outcomes after stroke and proposed our suggestions on developing AI-based PPPM strategies.

            "chunk": "BACKGROUND: Patients are referred to functional coronary artery disease (CAD) testing based on their pre-test probability (PTP) to search for myocardial ischemia. The recommended prediction tools incorporate three variables (symptoms, age, sex) and are easy to use, but have a limited diagnostic accuracy. Hence, a substantial proportion of non-invasive functional tests reveal no myocardial ischemia, leading to unnecessary radiation exposure and costs. Therefore, preselection of patients before ischemia testing needs to be improved using a more predictive and personalised approach. AIMS: Using multiple variables (symptoms, vitals, ECG, biomarkers), artificial intelligence-based tools can provide a detailed and individualised profile of each patient. This could improve PTP assessment and provide a more personalised diagnostic approach in the framework of predictive, preventive and personalised medicine (PPPM). METHODS: Consecutive patients (n = 2417) referred for Rubidium-82 positron emission tomography were evaluated. PTP was calculated using the ESC 2013/2019 and ACC 2012/2021 guidelines, and a memetic pattern-based algorithm (MPA) was applied incorporating symptoms, vitals, ECG and biomarkers. Five PTP categories from very low to very high PTP were defined (i.e., < 5%, 5-15%, 15-50%, 50-85%, > 85%). Ischemia was defined as summed difference score (SDS) >/= 2. RESULTS: Ischemia was present in 37.1%. The MPA model was most accurate to predict ischemia (AUC: 0.758, p < 0.001 compared to ESC 2013, 0.661; ESC 2019, 0.673; ACC 2012, 0.585; ACC 2021, 0.667). Using the < 5% threshold, the MPA's sensitivity and negative predictive value to rule out ischemia were 99.1% and 96.4%, respectively. The model allocated patients more evenly across PTP categories, reduced the proportion of patients in the intermediate (15-85%) range by 29% (ACC 2012)-51% (ESC 2019), and was the only tool to correctly predict ischemia prevalence in the very low PTP category. CONCLUSION: The MPA model enhanced ischemia testing according to the PPPM framework:The MPA model improved individual prediction of ischemia significantly and could safely exclude ischemia based on readily available variables without advanced testing (\"predictive\").It reduced the proportion of patients in the intermediate PTP range. Therefore, it could be used as a gatekeeper to prevent patients from further unnecessary downstream testing, radiation exposure and costs (\"preventive\").Consequently, the MPA model could transform ischemia testing towards a more personalised diagnostic algorithm (\"personalised\").

            "chunk": "INTRODUCTION:  Advancements within the field of medicine revolve around increasing the efficiency of diagnosing and subsequently treating patients. One such advancement is measurements of the central canal using artificial intelligence (AI). The authors propose the possibility of AI measuring two linear distances followed by a subsequent approximation via an area equation. The lumbar spinal canal was approximated by an area calculation using the interpedicular distance (IPD) and anteroposterior diameter (AP diameter). The three shapes evaluated were an ellipse, triangle, and rectangle. METHODS:  IPD, AP diameter, and spinal canal area from L1-L5 were measured in 555 patients using the IMPAX6 (Mortsel, Belgium: Agfa-Gevaert) picture archiving and communication system. Subsequently, an approximated area of the lumbar spinal canal, assuming an ellipse shape, was calculated using ellipse equation/approximation. Triangular and rectangular approximations were done using triangle equation/approximation and rectangle equation/approximation, respectively. The equations used are the geometric equations for the area of each shape described. For example, the triangular approximation used the IPD as the base of the triangle and the AP diameter as the height. Thus, the area approximation was calculated by half of the IPD times the AP diameter. RESULTS:  The percent error of the ellipse approximation was the lowest with a range of error from 8.44% at L1 to 15.51% at L5. The triangle approximation again was the second most accurate with a range of error starting at -26.46% at L5 to -30.96% at L1. Lastly, the percentage errors of the rectangle approximation began at 38.07% at L1 to 47.07% at L5. The ellipse and rectangle approximation consistently overestimated the area of the spinal canal, while the opposite was true for the triangle approximation. A combination of these approximations could be used to construct a second-order approximation. The approximations were all highly correlated with the authors' manual measurements. Approximations at the L2 vertebrae were highest with a correlation of 0.934 closely followed by all approximations at L5 with a value of 0.931. Approximations were least correlated with the L4 vertebrae with a value of 0.905. CONCLUSION: The correlation between the approximation equations and the measured values is significantly related. The ellipse equation best predicted the area of the spinal canal followed by the triangle and then the rectangle approximation. The percent error difference of the ellipse approximation at L1 was similar in error compared to other causes of measurement error. Continued investigation into a second-order approximation may yield a more accurate approximation.",

Therefore, there is a need to establish a framework that enhances productivity and quality of work to achieve the net-zero from industry. In this study, a comprehensive and generic analytical framework has been established to mitigate or lessen the research and technological gap in the manufacturing sector. In addition to that, the key stages involved in artificial intelligence (AI) based modelling and optimization analysis for manufacturing systems have also been incorporated. To assess the proposed AI framework, electric discharge machining (EDM) as a case study has been selected. The focus enlightens the emergence of optimizing the material removal rate (MRR) and surface roughness (SR) for Inconel 617 (IN617) material. A full factorial design of the experiment was carried out for experimentation. After that, an artificial neural network (ANN) as a modelling framework is selected, and fine-tuning of hyperparameters during training has been carried out. To validate the predictive performance of the trained models, an external validation (Val(ext)) test has been conducted. Through sensitivity analysis (SA) on the developed AI framework, the most influential factors affecting MRR and SR in EDM have been identified. Specifically, powder concentration (C(p)) contributes the most to the percentage significance, accounting for 79.00 % towards MRR, followed by treatment (16.35 %) and 4.67 % surfactant concentration (S(c)). However, the highest % significance in SR is given by S(c) (36.86 %), followed by C(p) (33.23 %), and then treatment (29.90 %), respectively. Furthermore, a parametric optimization has been performed using the framework and found that MRR and SR are 93.75 % and 58.90 % better than experimental data. This successful performance optimization proposed by the framework has the potential for application to other manufacturing systems.",

This observation can be attributed to several factors including, but not limited to, pest resistance, lack of novelty with respect to modes of action or classes of chemistry, and regulatory action. Due to current and projected increases of the global population, it is evident that the demand for food, and consequently, the usage of pesticides to improve yields will increase. Addressing these challenges and needs while promoting new crop protection agents through an increasingly stringent regulatory landscape requires the development and integration of infrastructures for innovative, cost- and time-effective discovery and development of novel and sustainable molecules. Significant advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and cheminformatics over the last two decades have improved the decision-making power of research scientists in the discovery of bioactive molecules. AI- and cheminformatics-driven molecule discovery offers the opportunity of moving experiments from the greenhouse to a virtual environment where thousands to billions of molecules can be investigated at a rapid pace, providing unbiased hypothesis for lead generation, optimization, and effective suggestions for compound synthesis and testing. To date, this is illustrated to a far lesser extent in the publicly available agrochemical research literature compared to drug discovery. In this review, we provide an overview of the crop protection discovery pipeline and how traditional, cheminformatics, and AI technologies can help to address the needs and challenges of agrochemical discovery towards rapidly developing novel and more sustainable products.",

Emotional intelligence (EI), an emerging term, has not yet been extensively researched in relation to Physical Activity (PA). Thus, the aim of the present study was to examine the relationship between EI on the PA of university undergraduates. METHODS: Cross sectional design was used to conduct the study. A total of 400 Colombo district state university undergraduates were included in the sample. The participants filled out two standard questionnaires. Wong and Low questionnaire to measure EI and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ- Long Form) to measure physical activity. Convenience sampling has been used in order to collect the data. SPSS 25.0 software was used to process and analyze the data with Spearman's test and Mann-Whitney U-test. RESULTS: The rate of significance is 0.061 and as it is greater than 0.05 and the test results are not significant, the null hypothesis was accepted, and the hypothesis was rejected. At the same time, there was a weak negative correlation between EI and PA, which was statistically not significant - rs = - 0.094, p = 0.061. CONCLUSION: It is crucial to emphasize and put into practice the need for undergraduates to engage in more PA. The findings provide a basis for research aimed at determining the relationship between EI and PA.",

GPT-4, a cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) model known for its advanced chat interface, was tested on nine surgical scenarios of varying complexity. To optimize the performance of GPT-4, prompt engineering techniques were used to guide the model's responses and improve the relevance and accuracy of its output. A panel of expert plastic surgeons evaluated the responses using a Likert scale to assess the model's performance, based on five distinct criteria. Each criterion was scored on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 representing the highest possible score. GPT-4 demonstrated a high level of performance, achieving an average score of 4.34 across all cases, consistent across different complexities. The study highlights the ability of GPT-4 to understand and respond to complicated surgical scenarios. However, the study also identifies potential areas for improvement. These include refining the prompts used to elicit responses from the model and providing targeted training with specialized, up-to-date sources. This study demonstrates a new approach to exploring large language models and highlights potential future applications of AI. These could improve patient care, refine surgical outcomes, and even change the way we approach complex clinical scenarios in plastic surgery. However, the intrinsic limitations of AI in its current state, together with the potential ethical considerations and the inherent uncertainty of unanticipated issues, serve to reiterate the indispensable role and unparalleled value of human plastic surgeons.",

Different machine learning algorithms were utilised to develop predictive models. A videolaryngoscopy view of Cormack-Lehane grade of 1 or 2 was classified as 'non-difficult', while grade 3 or 4 was classified as 'difficult'. A total of 5849 patients were included, of whom 5335 had non-difficult and 514 had difficult videolaryngoscopy. The facial model (only including facial images) using the Light Gradient Boosting Machine algorithm showed the highest area under the curve (95%CI) of 0.779 (0.733-0.825) with a sensitivity (95%CI) of 0.757 (0.650-0.845) and specificity (95%CI) of 0.721 (0.626-0.794) in the test set. Compared with bedside examination and multivariate scores (El-Ganzouri and Wilson), the facial model had significantly higher predictive performance (p < 0.001). Artificial intelligence-based facial analysis is a feasible technique for predicting difficulty during videolaryngoscopy, and the model developed using neural networks has higher predictive performance than traditional methods.",

            "chunk": "Developing compounds with novel structures is important for the production of new drugs. From an intellectual perspective, confirming the patent status of newly developed compounds is essential, particularly for pharmaceutical companies. The generation of a large number of compounds has been made possible because of the recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI). However, confirming the patent status of these generated molecules has been a challenge because there are no free and easy-to-use tools that can be used to determine the novelty of the generated compounds in terms of patents in a timely manner; additionally, there are no appropriate reference databases for pharmaceutical patents in the world. In this study, two public databases, SureChEMBL and Google Patents Public Datasets, were used to create a reference database of drug-related patented compounds using international patent classification. An exact structure search system was constructed using InChIKey and a relational database system to rapidly search for compounds in the reference database. Because drug-related patented compounds are a good source for generative AI to learn useful chemical structures, they were used as the training data. Furthermore, molecule generation was successfully directed by increasing and decreasing the number of generated patented compounds through incorporation of patent status (i.e., patented or not) into learning. The use of patent status enabled generation of novel molecules with high drug-likeness. The generation using generative AI with patent information would help efficiently propose novel compounds in terms of pharmaceutical patents. Scientific contribution: In this study, a new molecule-generation method that takes into account the patent status of molecules, which has rarely been considered but is an important feature in drug discovery, was developed. The method enables the generation of novel molecules based on pharmaceutical patents with high drug-likeness and will help in the efficient development of effective drug compounds.",

            "chunk": "BACKGROUND: Complete reporting is essential for clinical research. However, the endorsement of reporting guidelines in radiological journals is still unclear. Further, as a field extensively utilizing artificial intelligence (AI), the adoption of both general and AI reporting guidelines would be necessary for enhancing quality and transparency of radiological research. This study aims to investigate the endorsement of general reporting guidelines and those for AI applications in medical imaging in radiological journals, and explore associated journal characteristic variables. METHODS: This meta-research study screened journals from the Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging category, Science Citation Index Expanded of the 2022 Journal Citation Reports, and excluded journals not publishing original research, in non-English languages, and instructions for authors unavailable. The endorsement of fifteen general reporting guidelines and ten AI reporting guidelines was rated using a five-level tool: \"active strong\", \"active weak\", \"passive moderate\", \"passive weak\", and \"none\". The association between endorsement and journal characteristic variables was evaluated by logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: We included 117 journals. The top-five endorsed reporting guidelines were CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials, 58.1%, 68/117), PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses, 54.7%, 64/117), STROBE (STrengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology, 51.3%, 60/117), STARD (Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy, 50.4%, 59/117), and ARRIVE (Animal Research Reporting of In Vivo Experiments, 35.9%, 42/117). The most implemented AI reporting guideline was CLAIM (Checklist for Artificial Intelligence in Medical Imaging, 1.7%, 2/117), while other nine AI reporting guidelines were not mentioned. The Journal Impact Factor quartile and publisher were associated with endorsement of reporting guidelines in radiological journals. CONCLUSIONS: The general reporting guideline endorsement was suboptimal in radiological journals. The implementation of reporting guidelines for AI applications in medical imaging was extremely low. Their adoption should be strengthened to facilitate quality and transparency of radiological study reporting.",

This study aims to demonstrate the presence and the severity of the esophageal burn after caustic substance ingestion can be predicted with complete blood count parameters. METHODS: A multicenter, national, retrospective cohort study was performed on all caustic substance cases between 2000 and 2018. The classification learner toolbox of MATLAB version R2021a was used for the classification problem. Machine learning algorithms were used to forecast caustic burn. RESULTS: Among 1839 patients, 142 patients (7.7%) had burns. The type of the caustic and the PDW (platelet distribution width) values were the most important predictors. In the acid group, the AUC (area under curve) value was 84% while it was 70% in the alkaline group. The external validation had 85.17% accuracy in the acidic group and 91.66% in the alkaline group. CONCLUSIONS: Artificial intelligence systems have a high potential to be used in the prediction of caustic burns in pediatric age groups.",

METHODS: Medical charts of infants with a birth weight <1500 g who received either dopamine (Dp) or dobutamine (Db), were reviewed. Treatment response (TR) occurred if blood pressure increased >3rd centile for gestational age or superior vena cava flow was maintained >55 ml/kg/min, with decreased lactate or less negative base excess, without additional CVS. A predictive model of Dp and Db on TR was designed and the impact of TR on survival was analyzed. RESULTS: Sixty-six infants (median gestational age 27.3 weeks, median birth weight 864 g) received Dp (n = 44) or Db (n = 22). TR occurred in 59% of the cases treated with Dp and 31% with Db, p = 0.04. Machine learning identified a model that correctly labeled Db response in 90% of the cases and Dp response in 61.4%. Sixteen infants died (9% of the TR group, 39% of the TF group; p = 0.004). Brain or gut morbidity-free survival was observed in 52% vs 30% in the TR and TF groups, respectively (p = 0.08). CONCLUSIONS: New predictive models can anticipate Db but not Dp effectiveness in preterm infants. These algorithms may help the clinicians in the decision-making process. IMPACT: Failure of cardiovascular support treatment increases the risk of mortality in very low birth weight infants. A predictive model built with machine learning techniques can help anticipate treatment response to dobutamine with high accuracy. Predictive models based on artificial intelligence may guide the clinicians in the decision-making process.",

Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is one of the most prevalent and deadliest types of CVDs and is responsible for 45% of all CVD-related fatalities. IHD occurs when the blood supply to the heart is reduced due to narrowed or blocked arteries, which causes angina pectoris (AP) chest pain. AP is a common symptom of IHD and can indicate a higher risk of heart attack or sudden cardiac death. Therefore, it is important to diagnose and treat AP promptly and effectively. To forecast AP in women, we constructed a novel artificial intelligence (AI) method employing the tree-based algorithm known as an Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM). EBM is a machine learning (ML) technique that combines the interpretability of linear models with the flexibility and accuracy of gradient boosting. We applied EBM to a dataset of 200 female patients, 100 with AP and 100 without AP, and extracted the most relevant features for AP prediction. We then evaluated the performance of EBM against other AI methods, such as Logistic Regression (LR), Categorical Boosting (CatBoost), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM). We found that EBM was the most accurate and well-balanced technique for forecasting AP, with accuracy (0.925) and Youden's index (0.960). We also looked at the global and local explanations provided by EBM to better understand how each feature affected the prediction and how each patient was classified. Our research showed that EBM is a useful AI method for predicting AP in women and identifying the risk factors related to it. This can help clinicians to provide personalized and evidence-based care for female patients with AP.",

The ability to anticipate air quality in advance is critical for public authorities and the general public to plan and manage these activities, which ultimately help in minimizing the adverse impact on the environment and public health effectively. Thanks to recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence and sensor technology, forecasting air quality is possible through the consideration of various environmental factors. This paper presents our novel solution for air quality prediction and its correlation with different environmental factors and urban activities, such as traffic density. To this aim, we propose a multi-modal framework by integrating real-time data from different environmental sensors and traffic density extracted from Closed Circuit Television footage. The framework effectively addresses data inconsistencies arising from sensor and camera malfunctions within a streaming dataset. The dataset exhibits real-world complexities, including abrupt camera or station activations/deactivations, noise interference, and outliers. The proposed system tackles the challenge of predicting air quality at locations having no sensors or experiencing sensor failures by training a joint model on the data obtained from nearby stations/sensors using a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)-based merit fusion of the sensor data. The proposed methodology is evaluated using various variants of the LSTM model including Bi-directional LSTM, CNN-LSTM, and Convolutions LSTM (ConvLSTM) obtaining an improvement of 48%, 67%, and 173% for short-term, medium-term, and long-term periods, respectively, over the ARIMA model.",

METHODS: Sixty patients with mild to moderate AD were randomly divided into an acupuncture + medication group (30 cases, 3 cases dropped out) and a western medication group (30 cases, 2 cases dropped out). In the western medication group, the donepezil hydrochloride tablets were administered orally, 2.5 mg to 5 mg each time, once daily; and adjusted to be 10 mg each time after 4 weeks of medication. Besides the therapy as the western medication group, in the acupuncture + medication group, acupuncture was supplemented at the acupoints for Yizhi Tiaoshen, i.e. Baihui (GV 20), Sishencong (EX-HN 1), and bilateral Shenmen (HT 7), Neiguan (PC 6), Zusanli (ST 36), Sanyinjiao (SP 6) and Xuanzhong (GB 39). The needles were retained for 30 min in one treatment, once daily; and 6 treatments were required weekly. The duration of treatment was 6 weeks in each group. The general cognitive function was assessed by the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and Alzheimer's disease assessment scale-cognitive part (ADAS-Cog) before and after treatment in the two groups. Using the rs-fMRI, the changes in the functional connectivity (FC) of the left hippocampus and the whole brain before and after treatment were analyzed in the patients of the two groups (11 cases in the acupuncture + medication group and 12 cases in the western medication group). RESULTS: After treatment, compared with those before treatment, MMSE scores increased and ADAS-Cog scores decreased in the two groups (P<0.05); MMSE score was higher, while the ADAS-Cog score was lower in the acupuncture + medication group when compared with those in the western medication group (P</=0.05). After treatment, in the western medication group, FC of the left hippocampus was enhanced with the left fusiform gyrus, the inferior frontal gyrus of the left triangular region, the bilateral superior temporal gyrus and the right superior parietal gyrus (P<0.05), while FC was weakened with the left inferior temporal gyrus, the left middle frontal gyrus and the right dorsolateral superior frontal gyrus when compared with that before treatment (P<0.05). After treatment, in the acupuncture + medication group, FC of the left hippocampus was increased with the right gyrus rectus, the left inferior occipital gyrus, the right superior temporal gyrus and the left middle occipital gyrus (P<0.05), and it was declined with the left thalamus (P<0.05) when compared with those before treatment. After treatment, in the acupuncture + medication group, FC of the left hippocampus was strengthened with the bilateral inferior temporal gyrus, the bilateral middle temporal gyrus, the right gyrus rectus, the bilateral superior occipital gyrus, the left lenticular nucleus putamen, the left calcarine fissure and surrounding cortex, the inferior frontal gyrus of the left insulae operculum, the left medial superior frontal gyrus and the right posterior central gyrus (P<0.05) compared with that of the western medication group. CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture at the acupoints for Yizhi Tiaoshen improves the cognitive function of AD patients, and its main brain functional mechanism is related to intensifying the functional connectivity of the left hippocampus with the default network (inferior temporal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus and superior frontal gyrus, gyrus rectus), as well as with the sensory (posterior central gyrus) and visual (calcarine fissure and surrounding cortex and superior occipital gyrus) brain regions.",

            "chunk": "BACKGROUND: The burden of asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) is greater than that of heart failure; however, a cost-effective tool for asymptomatic LVD screening has not been well validated. We aimed to prospectively validate an artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled electrocardiogram (ECG) algorithm for asymptomatic LVD detection and evaluate its cost-effectiveness for opportunistic screening. METHODS: In this prospective observational study, patients undergoing ECG at outpatient clinics or health check-ups were enrolled in two hospitals in Taiwan. Patients were stratified into LVD (LVEF <= 40%) risk groups using a previously developed ECG algorithm. The performance of AI-ECG was used to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of LVD screening compared with no screening. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and sensitivity analyses were employed to examine the cost-effectiveness and robustness of the results. RESULTS: Among the 29,137 patients, the algorithm demonstrated area-under-the-curves of 0.984 and 0.945 for detecting LVD within 28 days in the two hospital cohorts. For patients not initially scheduled for an echocardiogram, the algorithm predicted future echocardiograms (high-risk, 46.2%; medium-risk, 31.4%; low-risk, 14.6%) and LVD at 12 months (high-risk, 26.2%; medium-risk, 3.4%; low-risk, 0.1%). Opportunistic screening with AI-ECG could result in a negative ICER of -$7,439 for patients aged 65, with consistent cost-savings across age groups and particularly in men. Approximately 91.5% of the cases were found to be cost-effective at the willingness-to-pay of $30,000 in the probabilistic analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The use of AI-ECG for asymptomatic LVD risk stratification is promising, and opportunistic screening in outpatient clinics has the potential to save costs.",

However, integrating these measurements into complex disease recognition and therapeutic interventions remains challenging. While the tools have been developed, there is a lack of evidence regarding implementing heterogeneous systems for guiding clinical decision-making and therapeutic action. RECENT FINDINGS: Newer AI modalities have shown concrete positive data in terms of user-guided image acquisition and processing, precise determination of both basic and advanced quantitative echocardiographic features, and the potential to construct predictive models, all with the possibility of seamless integration into clinical decision support systems. AI in echocardiography is a powerful and ever-growing tool with the potential for revolutionary effects on the practice of cardiology. In this review article, we explore the growth of AI and its applications in echocardiography, along with clinical implications and the associated regulatory, legal, and ethical considerations.",

Appropriate deep learning techniques in natural images have been extended to computational pathology. Still, they seldom take into account prior knowledge in pathology, especially the analysis process of lesion morphology by pathologists. Inspired by the diagnosis decision of pathologists, we design a novel deep learning architecture based on tree-like strategies called DeepTree. It imitates pathological diagnosis methods, designed as a binary tree structure, to conditionally learn the correlation between tissue morphology, and optimizes branches to finetune the performance further. To validate and benchmark DeepTree, we build a dataset of frozen lung cancer tissues and design experiments on a public dataset of breast tumor subtypes and our dataset. Results show that the deep learning architecture based on tree-like strategies makes the pathological image classification more accurate, transparent, and convincing. Simultaneously, prior knowledge based on diagnostic strategies yields superior representation ability compared to alternative methods. Our proposed methodology helps improve the trust of pathologists in artificial intelligence analysis and promotes the practical clinical application of pathology-assisted diagnosis.",

            "chunk": "BACKGROUND: There are still unanswered questions regarding effective educational strategies to promote the transformation and articulation of clinical data while teaching and learning clinical reasoning. Additionally, understanding how this process can be analyzed and assessed is crucial, particularly considering the rapid growth of natural language processing in artificial intelligence. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to map educational strategies to promote the transformation and articulation of clinical data among students and health care professionals and to explore the methods used to assess these individuals' transformation and articulation of clinical data. METHODS: This scoping review follows the Joanna Briggs Institute framework for scoping reviews and the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) checklist for the analysis. A literature search was performed in November 2022 using 5 databases: CINAHL (EBSCOhost), MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), PsycINFO (Ovid), and Web of Science (Clarivate). The protocol was registered on the Open Science Framework in November 2023. The scoping review will follow the 9-step framework proposed by Peters and colleagues of the Joanna Briggs Institute. A data extraction form has been developed using key themes from the research questions. RESULTS: After removing duplicates, the initial search yielded 6656 results, and study selection is underway. The extracted data will be qualitatively analyzed and presented in a diagrammatic or tabular form alongside a narrative summary. The review will be completed by February 2024. CONCLUSIONS: By synthesizing the evidence on semantic transformation and articulation of clinical data during clinical reasoning education, this review aims to contribute to the refinement of educational strategies and assessment methods used in academic and continuing education programs. The insights gained from this review will help educators develop more effective semantic approaches for teaching or learning clinical reasoning, as opposed to fragmented, purely symptom-based or probabilistic approaches. Besides, the results may suggest some ways to address challenges related to the assessment of clinical reasoning and ensure that the assessment tasks accurately reflect learners' developing competencies and educational progress.

            "chunk": "BACKGROUND: Inadequate control of atopic dermatitis (AD) increases the frequency of exacerbations and reduces the quality of life. Mobile health apps provide information and communication technology and may increase treatment adherence and facilitate disease management at home. The mobile health app, Atopic App, designed for patients and their caregivers, and the associated web-based patient education program, Atopic School, provide an opportunity for improving patients' and caregivers' engagement and adherence to the management of AD. OBJECTIVE: This noninterventional, observational study aimed to explore the feasibility and potential impact on the management of AD in children by caregivers using the Atopic App mobile health app. METHODS: The patient-oriented eczema measure (POEM) and numerical rating scale for the grading of pruritus were used as severity scores (scale range: 0-28). The artificial intelligence model of the app was used to assess the severity of AD based on the eczema area and severity index approach. The deidentified data enabled the analysis of the severity of AD, treatment plan history, potential triggers of flare-ups, usage of available features of the app, and the impact of patient education. RESULTS: During a 12-month period, of the 1223 users who installed the app, 910 (74.4%) registered users were caregivers of children with AD. The web-based Atopic School course was accessed by 266 (29.2%) caregivers of children with AD, 134 (50.4%) of whom completed the course. Usage of the app was significantly more frequent among those who completed the Atopic School program than among those who did not access or did not complete the course (P<.001). Users who completed a second POEM 21 to 27 days apart exhibited a significant improvement of AD severity based on the POEM score (P<.001), with an average improvement of 3.86 (SD 6.85) points. The artificial intelligence severity score and itching score were highly correlated with the POEM score (r=0.35 and r=0.52, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The Atopic App provides valuable real-world data on the epidemiology, severity dynamics, treatment patterns, and exacerbation-trigger correlations in patients with AD. The significant reduction in the POEM score among users of the Atopic App indicates a potential impact of this tool on health care engagement by caregivers of children with AD.",

To this end, this study recruited 822 college students with prior experience using ChatGPT (407 males and 415 females) and conducted an online survey. We tested the effects of ChatGPT literacy on user satisfaction and the mediating roles of different motives (i.e., information and knowledge acquisition and entertainment and leisure) in the relationship between ChatGPT literacy and user satisfaction. The results suggest that ChatGPT literacy significantly increases user satisfaction and that information and knowledge acquisition and entertainment and leisure partially mediate the relationship between the effect of ChatGPT literacy and user satisfaction.

            "chunk": "INTRODUCTION: Few studies on adolescents have investigated intelligence quotient (IQ) in mood disorders. Evidence on Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD), a controversial entity among depressive disorders, is more limited. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed an exploratory study on adolescent inpatients with unipolar mood disorders to test specific impairment in cognitive and adaptive profile. We also considered common psychopathological comorbidities. We retrospectively collected data on inpatients with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD), DMDD or Depressive Disorder - Not Otherwise Specified (DD-NOS) evaluated with Wechsler Scales of Intelligence, Adaptive Behavior Assessment System (ABAS-II), and Children's Global Assessment Scale (C-GAS). RESULTS: Out of 198 inpatients (85.9% females), 33.3% had MDD, 60.1% DD-NOS and 6.6% DMDD. DMDD patients had higher rates of ADHD (15.4%) and learning disorders (LD, 23.1%), a lower mean IQ (87.8 +/- 10.7; p = 0.001) and ABAS-II scores (general composite 68.8 +/- 16.8; p = 0.002) than other groups. In linear regression analysis, DMDD retained a significant correlation with lower IQ and adaptive abilities when controlling for sex, and comorbidities. Among comorbidities, LD correlated with lower perceptual reasoning and IQ, and ADHD with lower conceptual adaptive abilities. In all diagnosis groups, working memory and processing speed were lower than verbal comprehension and perceptual reasoning. DISCUSSION: While impairment in working memory and processing speed is a non-specific correlate of active mood disorder, DMDD is burdened by lower general intelligence and adaptive abilities and higher rate of neurodevelopmental comorbidities. Lower IQ in the normal range is a correlate of DMDD among variables examined, not explained by the effect of neurodevelopmental comorbidities. These findings are discussed with regards to possible implications for the consideration of DMDD as a bridge condition between neurodevelopmental disorders and mood disorders.",

Several diseases can now be treated in highly therapy-refractory or relapsed conditions. Currently, a number of CD19- or BCMA-specific CAR-T-cell therapies are approved for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), multiple myeloma (MM), and follicular lymphoma (FL). The implementation of these therapies has significantly improved patient outcome and survival even in cases with previously very poor prognosis. In this comprehensive review, we present the current state of research, recent innovations, and the applications of CAR-T-cell therapy in a selected group of hematologic malignancies. We focus on B- and T-cell malignancies, including the entities of cutaneous and peripheral T-cell lymphoma (T-ALL, PTCL, CTCL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), classical Hodgkin-Lymphoma (HL), Burkitt-Lymphoma (BL), hairy cell leukemia (HCL), and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM). While these diseases are highly heterogenous, we highlight several similarly used approaches (combination with established therapeutics, target depletion on healthy cells), targets used in multiple diseases (CD30, CD38, TRBC1/2), and unique features that require individualized approaches. Furthermore, we focus on current limitations of CAR-T-cell therapy in individual diseases and entities such as immunocompromising tumor microenvironment (TME), risk of on-target-off-tumor effects, and differences in the occurrence of adverse events. Finally, we present an outlook into novel innovations in CAR-T-cell engineering like the use of artificial intelligence and the future role of CAR-T cells in therapy regimens in everyday clinical practice.",

Alongside its many potential advantages, such as easing clinicians' workload and improving diagnostic accuracy, the use of AI raises ethical and legal concerns, to which there is still no unanimous response. A systematic literature review on medical professional liability related to the use of AI-based diagnostic algorithms was conducted using the public electronic database PubMed selecting studies published from 2020 to 2023. The systematic review was performed according to 2020 PRISMA guidelines. The literature review highlights how the issue of liability in case of AI-related error and patient's damage has received growing attention in recent years. The application of AI and diagnostic algorithm moreover raises questions about the risks of using unrepresentative populations during the development and about the completeness of information given to the patient. Concerns about the impact on the fiduciary relationship between physician and patient and on the subject of empathy have also been raised. The use of AI in medical field and the application of diagnostic algorithms introduced a revolution in the doctor-patient relationship resulting in multiple possible medico-legal consequences. The regulatory framework on medical liability when AI is applied is therefore inadequate and requires urgent intervention, as there is no single and specific regulation governing the liability of various parties involved in the AI supply chain, nor on end-users. Greater attention should be paid to inherent risk in AI and the consequent need for regulations regarding product safety as well as the maintenance of minimum safety standards through appropriate updates.",

            "chunk-id": 1,
            "chunk": "BACKGROUND: A substantial proportion of attendances to ophthalmic emergency departments are for non-urgent presentations. We developed and evaluated a machine learning system (DemDx Ophthalmology Triage System: DOTS) to optimise triage, with the aim of reducing inappropriate emergency attendances and streamlining case referral when necessary. METHODS: DOTS was built using retrospective tabular data from 11,315 attendances between July 1st, 2021, to June 15th, 2022 at Moorfields Eye Hospital Emergency Department (MEH) in London, UK. Demographic and clinical features were used as inputs and a triage recommendation was given (\"see immediately\", \"see within a week\", or \"see electively\"). DOTS was validated temporally and compared with triage nurses' performance (1269 attendances at MEH) and validated externally (761 attendances at the Federal University of Minas Gerais - UFMG, Brazil). It was also tested for biases and robustness to variations in disease incidences. All attendances from patients aged at least 18 years with at least one confirmed diagnosis were included in the study. FINDINGS: For identifying ophthalmic emergency attendances, on temporal validation, DOTS had a sensitivity of 94.5% [95% CI 92.3-96.1] and a specificity of 42.4% [38.8-46.1]. For comparison within the same dataset, triage nurses had a sensitivity of 96.4% [94.5-97.7] and a specificity of 25.1% [22.0-28.5]. On external validation at UFMG, DOTS had a sensitivity of 95.2% [92.5-97.0] and a specificity of 32.2% [27.4-37.0]. In simulated scenarios with varying disease incidences, the sensitivity was >/=92.2% and the specificity was >/=36.8%. No differences in sensitivity were found in subgroups of index of multiple deprivation, but the specificity was higher for Q2 when compared to Q4 (Q4 is less deprived than Q2). INTERPRETATION: At MEH, DOTS had similar sensitivity to triage nurses in determining attendance priority; however, with a specificity of 17.3% higher, DOTS resulted in lower rates of patients triaged to be seen immediately at emergency. DOTS showed consistent performance in temporal and external validation, in social-demographic subgroups and was robust to varying relative disease incidences. Further trials are necessary to validate these findings. This system will be prospectively evaluated, considering human-computer interaction, in a clinical trial.

            "chunk": "OBJECTIVES: The objective is to predict the development of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in discordant twins using a machine learning approach. METHODS: The records of 640 twin pairs born at 32-35 weeks gestational age (GA) with birth weight (BW) discordance were evaluated retrospectively. The infants' gender, GA, postmenstruel age at examination, BW, discordance rate, ROP Stages and Zones, and treatment options were recorded. The variables were used to develop a model to predict the development of ROP. Machine learning models were used for algorithm training and 10-fold cross-validation (CV) was applied for validation. The main measures were reported as sensitivity, specificity, receiver operating characteristic curve, and the area under the curve. RESULTS: A total of 640 twin pairs underwent ophthalmic examination, of which 55 (4.3%) were ROP. The infants' GA was 33.56+/-1.01 weeks (32-35 weeks) and BW was 1996+/-335 g (1000-3400 g). The mean discordance rate of the infants was 11.8+/-9.7% (0.0-53.9%). Using operating points, the Decision Tree algorithm detected ROP prediction with 71% sensitivity and 80% specificity in CV, while the Multi-Layer Perceptron algorithm detected 70% sensitivity and specificity. In addition, the X-Tree and Random Forest algorithms detected ROP prediction with 84% and 80% specificity, respectively. CONCLUSION: The results of this study support that BW discordance may be effective in the development of ROP in preterm twins and that artificial intelligence models can predict the development of ROP in accordance with clinical findings.",

This research therefore examines the role of antecedents, namely trust, attitude, and beliefs in driving AI acceptance in clinical practice. METHODS: We utilized online surveys to gather data from clinicians in the field of gastroenterology. RESULTS: A total of 164 participants responded to the survey. Participants had a mean age of 44.49 (SD = 9.65). Most participants were male (n = 116, 70.30%) and specialized in gastroenterology (n = 153, 92.73%). Based on the results collected, we proposed and tested a model of AI acceptance in medical practice. Our findings showed that while the proposed drivers had a positive impact on AI tools' acceptance, not all effects were direct. Trust and belief were found to fully mediate the effects of attitude on AI acceptance by clinicians. DISCUSSION: The role of trust and beliefs as primary mediators of the acceptance of AI in medical practice suggest that these should be areas of focus in AI education, engagement and training. This has implications for how AI systems can gain greater clinician acceptance to engender greater trust and adoption amongst public health systems and professional networks which in turn would impact how populations interface with AI. Implications for policy and practice, as well as future research in this nascent field, are discussed.",

            "chunk": "To develop next-generation lithium-ion batteries with enhanced stability and safety, it is crucial to understand the physicochemical principles of nonaqueous electrolytes. Kohlrausch's law describes a linear decrease in the molar conductivity (Lambda) with respect to the square root of the molarity of strong electrolytes at lower concentrations. This empirical law explains the impeded ionic mobility at higher concentrations due to ionic interactions, i.e., relaxation and asymmetric effects. However, this law does not hold at higher concentrations due to the ionic association that alleviates the ionic interactions and retards the decrease in the Lambda. Especially, the anomalously stagnant decrease in the Lambda near the solubility limit has not been clearly explained, calling for the consideration of other concentration-dependent factors such as the mean activity coefficient (gamma(+/-)), viscosity (eta), and dielectric constant (epsilon). Herein, we develop a systematic method to modify Kohlrausch's law. First, we install the ionic association constant, and the theoretical estimation is compared with the experimental results to induce the correction function that is related with the previously neglected concentration-dependent factors. Thus, the induced correction function was close to the rectified linear unit (ReLU) function, which has been widely used in the field of artificial intelligence. The modified Kohlrausch's law with the ReLU-type correction function provides a highly precise and reliable data fitting, and the fitted parameters showed clear concentration dependency and straightforward interpretability. As a result, this method effectively generalized Kohlrausch's law for nonaqueous electrolytes at higher concentrations up to the solubility limit of 3.0-3.5 M. Moreover, the modified Kohlrausch's law inspired us to discover the physical origins of the anomalously stagnant Lambda profiles near the solubility limit; and the most relevant physical origin of the anomaly was the concentration dependency of the gamma(+/-) and eta, which grow exponentially above a critical concentration.",

Retinal imaging, particularly Optical coherence tomography (OCT), has emerged as a crucial tool for investigating MS-related retinal injury. The integration of artificial intelligence(AI) has shown promise in enhancing OCT analysis for MS. Researchers are actively utilizing AI algorithms to accurately detect and classify MS-related abnormalities, leading to improved efficiency in diagnosis, monitoring, and personalized treatment planning. The prognostic value of AI in predicting MS disease progression has garnered substantial attention. Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms can analyze longitudinal OCT data to forecast the course of the disease, providing critical information for personalized treatment planning and improved patient outcomes. Early detection of high-risk patients allows for targeted interventions to mitigate disability progression effectively. As such, AI-driven approaches yielded remarkable abilities in classifying distinct MS subtypes based on retinal features, aiding in disease characterization and guiding tailored therapeutic strategies. Additionally, these algorithms have enhanced the accuracy and efficiency of OCT image segmentation, streamlined diagnostic processes, and reduced human error. This study reviews the current research studies on the integration of AI,including ML and DL algorithms, with OCT in the context of MS. It examines the advancements, challenges, potential prospects, and ethical concerns of AI-powered techniques in enhancing MS diagnosis, monitoring disease progression, revolutionizing patient care, the development of patient screening tools, and supported clinical decision-making based on OCT images.",

However, the contribution of positive maternal experiences, such as social support, to child cognitive development has received less attention. Furthermore, how maternal experience of social support during specific developmental periods impacts child cognitive development is largely unknown. METHODS: Using data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC; n = 5784) and the Prediction and Prevention of Preeclampsia and Intrauterine Growth Restriction study (PREDO; n = 420), we investigated the associations between maternal perceived social support during and after pregnancy and child's general cognitive ability at 8 years of age, assessed with the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC). Bayesian relevant life course modeling was used to investigate timing effects of maternal social support on child cognitive ability. RESULTS: In both cohorts, higher maternal perceived social support during pregnancy was associated with higher performance on the WISC, independent of sociodemographic factors and concurrent maternal symptoms of depression and anxiety. In ALSPAC, pregnancy emerged as a sensitive period for the effects of perceived social support on child cognitive ability, with a stronger effect of social support during pregnancy than after pregnancy on child cognitive ability. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings, supported from two prospective longitudinal cohorts, suggest a distinct role of maternal perceived social support during pregnancy for cognitive development in children. Our study suggests that interventions aimed at increasing maternal social support during pregnancy may be an important strategy for promoting maternal and child well-being.",

            "chunk": "RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems have been increasingly applied to breast ultrasonography. They are expected to decrease the workload of radiologists and to improve diagnostic accuracy. The aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of an AI system for the BI-RADS category assessment in breast masses detected on breast ultrasound. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 715 masses detected in 530 patients were analyzed. Three breast imaging centers of the same institution and nine breast radiologists participated in this study. Ultrasound was performed by one radiologist who obtained two orthogonal views of each detected lesion. These images were retrospectively reviewed by a second radiologist blinded to the patient's clinical data. A commercial AI system evaluated images. The level of agreement between the AI system and the two radiologists and their diagnostic performance were calculated according to dichotomic BI-RADS category assessment. RESULTS: This study included 715 breast masses. Of these, 134 (18.75%) were malignant, and 581 (81.25%) were benign. In discriminating benign and probably benign from suspicious lesions, the agreement between AI and the first and second radiologists was moderate statistically. The sensitivity and specificity of radiologist 1, radiologist 2, and AI were calculated as 98.51% and 80.72%, 97.76% and 75.56%, and 98.51% and 65.40%, respectively. For radiologist 1, the positive predictive value (PPV) was 54.10%, the negative predictive value (NPV) was 99.58%, and the accuracy was 84.06%. Radiologist 2 achieved a PPV of 47.99%, NPV of 99.32%, and accuracy of 79.72%. The AI system exhibited a PPV of 39.64%, NPV of 99.48%, and accuracy of 71.61%. Notably, none of the lesions categorized as BI-RADS 2 by AI were malignant, while 2 of the lesions classified as BI-RADS 3 by AI were subsequently confirmed as malignant. By considering AI-assigned BI-RADS 2 as safe, we could potentially avoid 11% (18 out of 163) of benign lesion biopsies and 46.2% (110 out of 238) of follow-ups. CONCLUSION: AI proves effective in predicting malignancy. Integrating it into the clinical workflow has the potential to reduce unnecessary biopsies and short-term follow-ups, which, in turn, can contribute to sustainability in healthcare practices.",

However, it can theoretically propagate over an unlimited distance while maintaining an extremely low inner core divergence of only 0.01 mrad. This makes it a promising candidate for precise long-distance alignment applications such as the alignment of particle accelerator components at CERN. In this work, a novel method to assess the symmetrical wavefront aberrations induced by an SLB generator is presented. Our approach is based on the analysis of a single-intensity distribution of an SLB. The coefficients of the Zernike polynomials are estimated using artificial intelligence before least-squares fitting is used to refine the result. This approach ensures that the fitting avoids local minima. This method provides a novel way to analyze the optical aberrations induced by the SLB generator.",

AI has gained increasing attention as a promising tool for next-generation drug development. METHODS: An AI method was used for drug repurposing and target identification for cancer. Among 8 survived candidates after background checking, N-(1-propyl-1H-1,3-benzodiazol-2-yl)-3-(pyrrolidine-1-sulfonyl) benzamide (Z29077885) was newly selected as an new anti-cancer drug, and the anti-cancer efficacy of Z29077885 was confirmed using cell viability, western blot, cell cycle, apoptosis assay in MDA-MB 231 and A549 in vitro. Then, anti-tumor efficacy of Z29077885 was validated in an in vivo A549 xenograft in BALB/c nude mice. RESULTS: First, we discovered an antiviral agent, Z29077885, as a new anticancer drug candidate using the AI deep learning method. Next, we demonstrated that Z29077885 inhibits Serine/threonine kinase 33 (STK33) enzymatic function in vitro and showed the anticancer efficacy in various cancer cells. Then, we found enhanced apoptosis via S-phase cell cycle arrest as the mechanism underlying the anticancer efficacy of Z29077885 in both lung and breast cancer cells. Finally, we confirmed the anti-tumor efficacy of Z29077885 in an in vivo A549 xenograft. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we used an AI-driven screening strategy to find a novel anticancer medication targeting STK33 that triggers cancer cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at the s phase. It will pave a way to efficiently discover new anticancer drugs.",

Therefore, a scoping review was conducted on PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Scopus databases. This review included articles that mention any AI application used by forensic pathologists or physicians in practice or any AI model applied in one expertise field of the forensic pathologist or physician. Articles in other languages than English or French or dealing mainly with complementary analyses handled by experts who are not forensic pathologists or physicians or with AI to analyze data for research purposes in forensic medicine were excluded from this review. All the relevant information was retrieved in each article from a grid analysis derived and adapted from the TRIPOD checklist. This review included 35 articles and revealed that AI applications are developed in thanatology and in clinical forensic medicine. However, those applications seem to mainly remain in research and development stages. Indeed, the use of AI applications by forensic pathologists or physicians is not actual due to issues discussed in this article.

We then investigated whether our proposed machine learning (ML) AI algorithm could accurately diagnose cataracts from videos recorded with this device. We collected 206,574 cataract frames from 1812 cataract eye videos. Ophthalmologists graded the nuclear cataracts (NUCs) using the cataract grading scale of the World Health Organization.

            "chunk": "Introduction Educational differences in cognitive performance among older adults are well-documented. Studies that explore this association typically estimate a single average effect of education on cognitive performance. We argue that the processes that contribute to the association between education and cognitive performance are unlikely to have equal effects at all levels of cognitive performance. In this study, we employ an analytical approach that enables us to go beyond averages to examine the association between education and five measures of global and domain-specific cognitive performance across the outcome distributions. Methods This cross-sectional study included 1780 older adults aged 58-68 years from the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam (LASA). Conditional quantile regression was used to examine variation across the outcome distribution. Cognitive outcomes included Mini-Mental State Examination score (MMSE), crystallized intelligence, information processing speed, episodic memory, and a composite score of global cognitive performance. Results The results showed that the associations between education and different cognitive measures varied across the outcome distributions. Specifically, we found that education had a stronger association with crystallized intelligence, MMSE, and a composite cognitive performance measure in the lower tail of the performance distributions. The associations between education and information processing speed and episodic memory were uniform across the outcome distributions. Conclusion Larger associations between education and some domains of cognitive performance in the lower tail of the performance distributions implies that inequalities are primarily generated among individuals with lower performance, rather than among average and high performers. Additionally, the varying associations across some of the outcome distributions indicate that estimating a single average effect through standard regression methods may overlook variations in cognitive performance between educational groups. Future studies should consider heterogeneity across the outcome distribution.",

            "chunk": "Radiology plays an important role in the initial diagnosis and staging of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). CT is the preferred modality over MRI, due to wider availability, greater consistency in image quality, and lower cost. MRI and PET/CT are usually reserved as problem-solving tools in select patients. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines define resectability criteria based on tumor involvement of the arteries and veins, and triage patients into resectable, borderline resectable, locally advanced, and metastatic categories. Patients with resectable disease are eligible for upfront surgical resection, while patients with high-stage disease are treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy with hopes of downstaging the disease. The accuracy of staging critically depends on imaging technique and the experience of the radiologists. Several challenges in accurate preoperative staging include prediction of lymph node metastases, detection of subtle liver and peritoneal metastases, and disease restaging following neoadjuvant therapy. Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to function as \"second readers\" to improve upon the radiologists' detection of small early-stage tumors, which can shift more patients toward surgical resection of potentially curable cancer. AI may also provide imaging biomarkers that can predict disease recurrence and patient survival after pancreatic resection and assist in selection of patients most likely to benefit from surgery thus improving patient outcomes.",

            "chunk": "Recognizing texts in images plays an important role in many applications, such as industrial intelligence, robot vision, automatic driving, command assistance, and scene understanding. Although great progress has been achieved in various fields, research on complex systems modeling using text recognition technology requires further attention. To address this, we propose a new end-to-end multi-task learning method, which includes a super-resolution branch (SRB) and a recognition branch. To effectively learn the semantic information of images, we utilize the feature pyramid network (FPN) to fuse high- and low-level semantic information. The feature map generated by FPN is then delivered separately to the super-resolution branch and the recognition branch. We introduce a novel super-resolution branch, the SRB based on the proposed dual attention mechanism (DAM), designed to enhance the capability of learning low-resolution text features. The DAM incorporates the residual channel attention to enhance channel dependencies and the character attention module to focus on context information. For the recognition branch, the feature map generated by FPN is fed into an RNN sequence module, and an attention-based decoder is constructed to predict the results. To address the issue of low-resolution text recognition in numerous Chinese scenes, we propose the Chinese super-resolution datasets instead of relying on traditional down-sampling techniques to generate training datasets. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method performs robustly on low-resolution text images and achieves competitive results on benchmark datasets.",

            "chunk": "Wearable thermal sensors based on thermoelectric (TE) materials with high sensitivity and temperature resolution are extensively used in medical diagnosis, human-machine interfaces, and advanced artificial intelligence. However, their development is greatly limited by the lack of materials with both a high Seebeck coefficient and superior anticrystallization ability. Here, a new inorganic amorphous TE material, Ge(15)Ga(10)Te(75), with a high Seebeck coefficient of 1109 muV/K is reported. Owing to the large difference between the glass-transition temperature and initial crystallization temperature, Ge(15)Ga(10)Te(75) strongly inhibits crystallization during fiber fabrication by thermally codrawing a precast rod comprising a Ge(15)Ga(10)Te(75) core and PP polymer cladding. The temperature difference can be effectively transduced into electrical signals to achieve TE fiber thermal sensing with an accurate temperature resolution of 0.03 K and a fast response time of 4 s. It is important to note that after the 1.5 and 5.5 K temperatures changed repeatedly, the TE properties of the fiber demonstrated high stability. Based on the Seebeck effect and superior flexibility of the fibers, they can be integrated into a mask and wearable fabric for human respiration and body temperature monitoring. The superior thermal sensing performance of the TE fibers together with their natural flexibility and scalable fabrication endow them with promising applications in health-monitoring and intelligent medical systems.",

            "chunk": "The development of ultrafast dynamic contrast-enhanced (UF-DCE) MRI has occurred in tandem with fast MRI scan techniques, particularly view-sharing and compressed sensing. Understanding the strengths of each technique and optimizing the relevant parameters are essential to their implementation. UF-DCE MRI has now shifted from research protocols to becoming a part of clinical scan protocols for breast cancer. UF-DCE MRI is expected to compensate for the low specificity of abbreviated MRI by adding kinetic information from the upslope of the time-intensity curve. Because kinetic information from UF-DCE MRI is obtained from the shape and timing of the initial upslope, various new kinetic parameters have been proposed. These parameters may be associated with receptor status or prognostic markers for breast cancer. In addition to the diagnosis of malignant lesions, more emphasis has been placed on predicting and evaluating treatment response because hyper-vascularity is linked to the aggressiveness of breast cancers. In clinical practice, it is important to note that breast lesion images obtained from UF-DCE MRI are slightly different from those obtained by conventional DCE MRI in terms of morphology. A major benefit of using UF-DCE MRI is avoidance of the marked or moderate background parenchymal enhancement (BPE) that can obscure the target enhancing lesions. BPE is less prominent in the earlier phases of UF-DCE MRI, which offers better lesion-to-noise contrast. The excellent contrast of early-enhancing vessels provides a key to understanding the detailed pathological structure of tumor-associated vessels. UF-DCE MRI is normally accompanied by a large volume of image data for which automated/artificial intelligence-based processing is expected to be useful. In this review, both the theoretical and practical aspects of UF-DCE MRI are summarized. EVIDENCE LEVEL: 5 TECHNICAL EFFICACY: Stage 2.",

Purpose To explore the potential benefit of artificial intelligence (AI) assistance in the detection of thoracic abnormalities on chest radiographs by evaluating the performance of radiologists with different levels of expertise, with and without AI assistance. Materials and Methods Patients who underwent both chest radiography and thoracic CT within 72 hours between January 2010 and December 2020 in a French public hospital were screened retrospectively. Radiographs were randomly included until reaching 500 radiographs, with about 50% of radiographs having abnormal findings. A senior thoracic radiologist annotated the radiographs for five abnormalities (pneumothorax, pleural effusion, consolidation, mediastinal and hilar mass, lung nodule) based on the corresponding CT results (ground truth). A total of 12 readers (four thoracic radiologists, four general radiologists, four radiology residents) read half the radiographs without AI and half the radiographs with AI (ChestView; Gleamer). Changes in sensitivity and specificity were measured using paired t tests. Results The study included 500 patients (mean age, 54 years +/- 19 [SD]; 261 female, 239 male), with 522 abnormalities visible on 241 radiographs. On average, for all readers, AI use resulted in an absolute increase in sensitivity of 26% (95% CI: 20, 32), 14% (95% CI: 11, 17), 12% (95% CI: 10, 14), 8.5% (95% CI: 6, 11), and 5.9% (95% CI: 4, 8) for pneumothorax, consolidation, nodule, pleural effusion, and mediastinal and hilar mass, respectively (P < .001). Specificity increased with AI assistance (3.9% [95% CI: 3.2, 4.6], 3.7% [95% CI: 3, 4.4], 2.9% [95% CI: 2.3, 3.5], and 2.1% [95% CI: 1.6, 2.6] for pleural effusion, mediastinal and hilar mass, consolidation, and nodule, respectively), except in the diagnosis of pneumothorax (-0.2%; 95% CI: -0.36, -0.04; P = .01). The mean reading time was 81 seconds without AI versus 56 seconds with AI (31% decrease, P < .001). Conclusion AI-assisted chest radiography interpretation resulted in absolute increases in sensitivity for all radiologists of various levels of expertise and reduced the reading times; specificity increased with AI, except in the diagnosis of pneumothorax.

            "chunk": "AIMS: Coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) imaging is used to diagnose patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD). A novel artificial-intelligence-guided quantitative computed tomography ischemia algorithm (AI-QCTischemia) aims to identify myocardial ischemia directly from CTA images and may be helpful to improve risk stratification. The aims were 1) the prognostic value of AI-QCTischemia among symptomatic patients with suspected CAD entering diagnostic imaging with coronary CTA, and 2) the prognostic value of AI-QCTischemia separately among patients with no/non-obstructive CAD (</=50% visual diameter stenosis) and obstructive CAD (>50% visual diameter stenosis). METHODS AND RESULTS: For this cohort study, AI-QCTischemia was calculated by blinded analysts among patients with suspected CAD undergoing coronary CTA. The primary endpoint was the composite of death, myocardial infarction (MI), or unstable angina pectoris (uAP) (median follow-up 6.9 years). 1880/2271 (83%) patients were analyzable by AI-QCTischemia. Patients with an abnormal AI-QCTischemia result (n = 509/1880) vs. patients with a normal AI-QCTischemia result (n = 1371/1880) had significantly higher crude and adjusted rates of the primary endpoint (HRadj 1.96,95% CI 1.46-2.63, p < 0.001; covariates: age/sex/hypertension/diabetes/smoking/typical angina). An abnormal AI-QCTischemia result was associated with significantly higher crude and adjusted rates of the primary endpoint among patients with no/non-obstructive CAD (n = 1373/1847) (HRadj 1.81,95% CI 1.09-3.00, p = 0.022), but not among those with obstructive CAD (n = 474/1847) (HRadj 1.26,95% CI 0.75-2.12, p = 0.386) (p-interaction = 0.032). CONCLUSION: Among patients with suspected CAD, an abnormal AI-QCTischemia result was associated with a 2-fold increased adjusted rate of long-term death, MI, or uAP. AI-QCTischemia may be useful to improve risk stratification, especially among patients with no/non-obstructive CAD on coronary CTA.",

This statement is based on the assumption that the ability to master natural languages is the ultimate frontier for this new paradigm and perhaps an essential step to achieving the so-called general artificial intelligence. Autonomous knowledge generation implies that a machine will be able, for instance, to retrieve and understand the contents of the scientific literature and provide interpretations for existing data, allowing it to propose and address new scientific problems. While one may assume that the continued development of AI tools exploiting large-language models, with more data used for training, may lead these systems to learn autonomously, this learning can be accelerated by devising human-assisted strategies to deal with specific tasks. For example, strategies may be implemented for AI tools to emulate the analysis of multivariate data by human experts or in identifying and explaining patterns in temporal series. In addition to generic AI tools, such as Chat AIs, one may conceive personal AI agents, potentially working together, that are likely to serve end users in the near future. In this perspective paper, we discuss the development of this type of agent, focusing on its architecture and requirements. As a proof-of-concept, we exemplify how such an AI agent could work to assist researchers in materials sciences.",

Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms can help detect and quantify CAC/ASCVD which can lead to early treatment and improved outcomes. METHODS: Using an FDA-approved algorithm (NANOX AI) to measure coronary artery calcium (CAC) on non-gated, non-contrast CT chest, 536 serial scans were evaluated in this single-center retrospective study. Scans were categorized by Agatston scores as normal-mild (<100), moderate (100-399), or severe (>/=400). AI results were validated by cardiologist's overread. Patient charts were retrospectively analyzed for clinical characteristics. RESULTS: Of the 527 patients included in this analysis, a total of 258 (48.96%) had moderate-severe disease; of these, 164 patients (63.57%, p< 0.001) had no previous diagnosis of CAD. Of those with moderate-severe disease 135 of 258 (52.33% p=0.006) were not on aspirin and 96 (37.21% p=0.093) were not on statin therapy. Cardiologist interpretation demonstrated 88.76% agreement with AI classification. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Machine learning utilized in CT scans obtained for non-cardiac indications can detect and semi-quantitate CAC accurately. Artificial intelligence algorithms can accurately be applied to non-gated, non-contrast CT scans to identify CAC/ASCVD allowing for early medical intervention and improved clinical outcomes.",

            "chunk": "Ovarian masses, ranging from benign cysts to malignant tumors, present complex diagnostic challenges in women's healthcare. Early detection of ovarian masses is paramount for improving patient outcomes, as delayed diagnoses often lead to advanced-stage disease with limited treatment options. This comprehensive review explores screening methods' current state, limitations, and emerging technologies to facilitate earlier detection. The limitations of existing screening methods, such as low sensitivity and specificity, underscore the need for improved early detection strategies. Imaging-based techniques, including transvaginal ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, and computed tomography, are vital in evaluating ovarian masses. However, the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) applications enhances the accuracy of image interpretation. Blood-based biomarkers, such as CA-125, have been the focus of research for ovarian mass detection. While CA-125 remains widely used, its limitations have prompted investigations into alternative serum biomarkers, including HE4 and miRNA, along with liquid biopsy and circulating tumor DNA. Ultrasound-based scoring systems, such as the risk of malignancy index (RMI), Ovarian-Adnexal Reporting and Data System (O-RADS), and guidelines from the International Ovarian Tumor Analysis (IOTA) group, provide structured approaches for classifying ovarian masses. These systems aid healthcare providers in clinical decision-making. Emerging technologies, such as liquid biopsy, AI, and proteomic/metabolomic approaches, offer promising avenues for enhancing early detection and risk assessment. Liquid biopsy provides noninvasive, real-time monitoring of ovarian masses, while AI and ML applications improve the accuracy of image interpretation. Proteomic and metabolomic studies reveal novel biomarkers and molecular insights. High-risk populations, often associated with genetic mutations such as BRCA1 and BRCA2, require specialized screening strategies. Current guidelines recommend screening modalities, risk-reduction strategies, and shared decision-making. Ongoing research focuses on refining risk assessment and personalized screening for high-risk individuals. This review underscores the importance of early detection in managing ovarian masses, emphasizing the need for improved screening methods, tailored approaches for high-risk populations, and ongoing research to further enhance diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes.",

Both pathogens infect a significant fraction of human population, both are neurotropic and survive in the host's body for a long time. While latent infections were thought to be clinically asymptomatic, recent studies suggest otherwise, revealing adverse effects on human health. It was hypothesised that the specific behavioural effects of these pathogens may be side effects of general health impairments in infected individuals. This hypothesis was tested using about one hour-long survey consisting of questionnaires and performance tests on a cohort of 7,762 members of the internet population. Results showed that individuals infected with T. gondii reported worse physical and mental health, and those infected with Borrelia spp. reported worse physical health than uninfected controls. Furthermore, infected and noninfected individuals differed in several personality traits, including conscientiousness, pathogen disgust, injury disgust, Machiavellianism, narcissism, tribalism, anti-authoritarianism, intelligence, reaction time, and precision. While the majority of behavioural effects associated with Borrelia infection were similar to those associated with Toxoplasma infection, some differences were observed, such as performance in the Stroop test. Path analyses and nonparametric partial Kendall correlation tests showed that these effects were not mediated by impaired health in infected individuals, contradicting the side effects hypothesis.",

To effectively combat this crisis, it is crucial to discover better opioid drugs with reduced addiction potential. Artificial intelligence-based and other machine learning tools, particularly deep learning models, have garnered significant attention in recent years for their potential to advance drug discovery. However, using these tools poses challenges, especially when training samples are insufficient to achieve adequate prediction performance. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of transfer learning in building robust deep learning models to enhance ligand bioactivity prediction for each individual opioid receptor (OR) subtype. This is achieved by leveraging knowledge obtained from pretraining a model using supervised learning on a larger data set of bioactivity data combined with ligand-based and structure-based molecular descriptors related to the entire OR subfamily. Our studies hold the potential to advance opioid research by enabling the rapid identification of novel chemical probes with specific bioactivities, which can aid in the study of receptor function and contribute to the future development of improved opioid therapeutics.",

            "chunk": "BACKGROUND: Excessive media use is known to be associated with executive dysfunction in children, but it's unclear whether this exposure can lead to long-term changes of executive function. This study aimed to investigate the association between media exposure and longitudinal changes in executive function within a population-based study, while considering the potential influence of intelligence. METHODS: This study used data from 1,209 participants in the Panel Korea Study for Children. The children's media exposure was measured at ages 7 and 8, and executive function was evaluated annually from ages 7 to 10 using the Executive Function Difficulty Screening Questionnaire. Participants were grouped by media exposure level (low, medium, or high), and longitudinal changes in executive function were analyzed using linear mixed effects models. Subgroup analysis was conducted to investigate how executive function changes varied based on intelligence within each media exposure group. RESULTS: Children with high media exposure (n = 97) had severer executive function difficulties than those with low (n = 141) or medium (n = 971) exposure in all waves. The high exposure group demonstrated persistent higher executive function difficulties up to age 10 after controlling for child gender, intelligence, parental education level and maternal depression. Children with intelligence quotient (IQ) </= 100 in the medium to high media exposure group had significantly more severe executive function difficulties than those with IQ > 100. CONCLUSION: This study provided evidence of a longitudinal negative association between media exposure and executive function. The findings suggest that excessive media exposure may lead to long-term changes in executive function in children and highlight the importance of implementing targeted interventions and educational strategies to mitigate the potential negative effects of excessive media use, particularly for children with lower cognitive abilities.",

We propose a screening strategy based on algorithms calculated from quantitative and analytical data from the XN analyser. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We tested the performance of previously published MDS and CMML scores on an evaluation cohort of 749 individual eligible patients over 50 years of age. These patients were classified into 3 groups as follows: 713 patients without MDS or CMML, 18 patients with MDS, and finally 18 patients with CMML. In a second step, a routine cohort of 37 828 samples was studied to evaluate the impact of this approach. RESULTS: The concordance rate between cytology and the two scores is 92.1%. The sensitivity and specificity of the CMML score are 100% and 96.2%, respectively. For the MDS score, they are 83.3% and 89.6% respectively. The ratio of platelets measured by fluorescence on board (PLT-F) as reflex tests generated is 1.5% after 6 months. The additional smear ratio for suspected MDS is calculated at 0.6%. CONCLUSION: We propose a flowchart using embedded artificial intelligence to help the cytologist in an optimized smear review and thus improve guidance to the clinician and the patients in the diagnosis process. This strategy permits a more comprehensive approach to MDS and CMML detection fitting with the new definition of CMML according to the recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO) published in 2022.",

But they still cannot outperform many artificial neural networks. Modularity is another crucial feature of the biological brain. It remains unclear if modularity can also improve the performance of SNNs. To investigate this idea, we proposed the modular SNN, and compared its performance with a uniform SNN without modularity by employing them to classify cortical spike trains. For the first time, a significant improvement was found in our modular SNN. Further, we probed into the factors influencing the performance of the modular SNN and found: (a). The modular SNN outperformed the uniform SNN more significantly when the number of neurons in the networks increased; (b). The performance of the modular SNNs increased as the number of modules dropped. These preliminary but novel findings suggest that modularity may help develop better artificial intelligence and brain-machine interfaces. Also, the modular SNN may serve as a model for the study of neuronal spike synchrony.",

However, these models demand considerable amounts of data, while the availability of unbiased training data is limited. Synthetic images can augment existing datasets, to improve and validate AI algorithms. Yet, controlling the exact distribution of cellular features within them is still challenging. One of the solutions is harnessing conditional generative adversarial networks that take a semantic mask as an input rather than a random noise. Unlike other domains, outlining the exact cellular structure of tissues is hard, and most of the input masks depict regions of cell types. This is also the case for non-small cell lung cancer, the most common type of lung cancer. Deciding whether a patient would receive immunotherapy depends on quantifying regions of stained cells. However, using polygon-based masks introduce inherent artifacts within the synthetic images - due to the mismatch between the polygon size and the single-cell size. In this work, we show that introducing random single-pixel noise with the appropriate spatial frequency into a polygon semantic mask can dramatically improve the quality of the synthetic images. We used our platform to generate synthetic images of immunohistochemistry-treated lung biopsies. We test the quality of the images using a three-fold validation procedure. First, we show that adding the appropriate noise frequency yields 87% of the similarity metrics improvement that is obtained by adding the actual single-cell features. Second, we show that the synthetic images pass the Turing test. Finally, we show that adding these synthetic images to the train set improves AI performance in terms of PD-L1 semantic segmentation performances. Our work suggests a simple and powerful approach for generating synthetic data on demand to unbias limited datasets to improve the algorithms' accuracy and validate their robustness.",

This study also compares the prediction results of three popular deep learning models on this dataset, ResNeXt101_32x32d achieving up to 82.05% for top-1 accuracy and 97.13% for top-5 accuracy. Besides, this paper uses a multi-model fusion method based on stacking in the field of food recognition for the first time. We built a meta-learner after the base model to integrate the three base models of different architectures to improve robustness. The accuracy achieves 82.88% for top-1 accuracy.Clinical Relevance-This study proves that the application of artificial intelligence technology in the identification of Chinese dishes is feasible, which can play a positive role in people who need to control their diet, such as diabetes and obesity.",

            "chunk": "Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most prevalent cancers in men. Early diagnosis plays a pivotal role in reducing the mortality rate from clinically significant PCa (csPCa). In recent years, bi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (bpMRI) has attracted great attention for the detection and diagnosis of csPCa. bpMRI is able to overcome some limitations of multi-parametric MRI (mpMRI) such as the use of contrast agents, the time-consuming for imaging and the costs, and achieve detection performance comparable to mpMRI. However, inter-reader agreements are currently low for prostate MRI. Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have propelled the development of deep learning (DL)-based computer-aided detection and diagnosis system (CAD). However, most of the existing DL models developed for csPCa identification are restricted by the scale of data and the scarcity in labels. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised pre-training scheme named SSPT-bpMRI with an image restoration pretext task integrating four different image transformations to improve the performance of DL algorithms. Specially, we explored the potential value of the self-supervised pre-training in fully supervised and weakly supervised situations. Experiments on the publicly available PI-CAI dataset demonstrate that our model outperforms the fully supervised or weakly supervised model alone.",

            "chunk": "Breast cancer is a global public health concern. For women with suspicious breast lesions, the current diagnosis requires a biopsy, which is usually guided by ultrasound (US). However, this process is challenging due to the low quality of the US image and the complexity of dealing with the US probe and the surgical needle simultaneously, making it largely reliant on the surgeon's expertise. Some previous works employing collaborative robots emerged to improve the precision of biopsy interventions, providing an easier, safer, and more ergonomic procedure. However, for these equipment to be able to navigate around the breast autonomously, 3D breast reconstruction needs to be available. The accuracy of these systems still needs to improve, with the 3D reconstruction of the breast being one of the biggest focuses of errors. The main objective of this work is to develop a method to obtain a robust 3D reconstruction of the patient's breast, based on RGB monocular images, which later can be used to compute the robot's trajectories for the biopsy. To this end, depth estimation techniques will be developed, based on a deep learning architecture constituted by a CNN, LSTM, and MLP, to generate depth maps capable of being converted into point clouds. After merging several from multiple points of view, it is possible to generate a real-time reconstruction of the breast as a mesh. The development and validation of our method was performed using a previously described synthetic dataset. Hence, this procedure takes RGB images and the cameras' position and outputs the breasts' meshes. It has a mean error of 3.9 mm and a standard deviation of 1.2 mm. The final results attest to the ability of this methodology to predict the breast's shape and size using monocular images.Clinical Relevance- This work proposes a method based on artificial intelligence and monocular RGB images to obtain the breast's volume during robotic guided breast biopsies, improving their execution and safety.",

An extension towards an AI-based emotional climate (EC) recognition, i.e., the recognition of the joint emotional atmosphere dynamically created and perceived by the peers throughout a conversation, is proposed here. In our approach, namely MLBispeC (Machine Learning Based Bispectral Classification), the peers' speech signals during their conversation are subjected to time-windowed bispectral analysis, allowing for feature extraction related to dynamic harmonics nonlinear interactions. In addition, peers' affect dynamics, derived from their same time-windowed emotion labeling, are combined to form an extended feature vector, inputted into two well-known machine learning classifiers (Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbor). MLBispeC was evaluated on the Interactive Emotional Dyadic Motion Capture (IEMOCAP) open access dataset, which contains 2D emotions, i.e., Arousal (A) and valence (V) that are divided into (low/high) classes. The experimental results have shown that MLBispeC outperforms previous state-of-the-art techniques, achieving an accuracy of 0.826A/0.754V, sensitivity of 0.864A/0.774V, and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.821A/0.799V. This demonstrates the effectiveness of MLBispeC to objectively recognize peers' EC during their conversation, allowing for insights into their emotional and social interactions.Clinical relevance-Unobtrusive, objective and dynamic recognition of the EC built during peers' conversation can scaffold effective assessment of patients with physiological, psychological, and mental diseases, at various age ranges (children, adults, and older adults).",

In this study, we introduce xAAEnet, a novel xAI model applied to the assessment of Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) severity. OSA is a prevalent sleep disorder that can lead to numerous medical conditions and is currently assessed using the Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI). However, AHI has been criticized for its inability to accurately estimate the effect of OSAs on related medical conditions. To address this issue, we propose a human-centric xAI approach that emphasizes similarity between apneic events as a whole and reduces subjectivity in diagnosis by examining how the model makes its decisions. Our model was trained and tested on a dataset of 60 patients' Polysomnographic (PSG) recordings. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model, xAAEnet, outperforms models with traditional architectures such as convolutional regressor, autoencoder (AE), and variational autoencoder (VAE). This study highlights the potential of xAI in providing an objective OSA severity scoring method.Clinical relevance- This study provides an objective OSA severity scoring technique which could improve the management of apneic patients in clinical practice.",

However, the risk of using an automated system for ECG analysis when noise is present can lead to incorrect diagnosis or treatment decisions. A noise detector is crucial to minimise the risk of incorrect diagnosis. Machine learning (ML) models are used in ECG noise detection before clinical decision-making systems to mitigate false alarms. However, it is essential to prove the generalisation capability of the ML model in different situations. ML models performance is 50% lesser when the model is trained with synthetic and tested with physiologic ECG datasets compared to trained and tested with physiologic ECG datasets. This suggests that the ML model must be trained with physiologic ECG datasets rather than synthetic ones or add more various types of noise in synthetic ECG datasets that can mimic physiologic ECG.Clinical relevance- ML model trained with synthetic noisy ECG can increase the 50% misclassification rate in ECG noise detection compared to training with physiologic ECG datasets.

Vessel cores were coated in silicone, surrounded in tissue-mimicking gel tailored for ultrasound and needle insertion, and dissolved with water. One upper arm and four inguinal phantoms were constructed. Operators used AI-GUIDE to deploy needles into phantom vessels.

Six operators (medical experience: none, 3; 1-5 years, 2; 5+ years, 1) inserted 27 inguinal needles with 81% (22/27) success in a median of 48 seconds. Seven operators performed 24 arm injections, without tuning the AI for arm anatomy, with 71% (17/24) success. After excluding failures due to motor malfunction and a defective needle, success rate was 100% (22/22) in the groin and 85% (17/20) in the arm.

            "chunk": "The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into digital pathology has the potential to automate and improve various tasks, such as image analysis and diagnostic decision-making. Yet, the inherent variability of tissues, together with the need for image labeling, lead to biased datasets that limit the generalizability of algorithms trained on them. One of the emerging solutions for this challenge is synthetic histological images. Debiasing real datasets require not only generating photorealistic images but also the ability to control the cellular features within them. A common approach is to use generative methods that perform image translation between semantic masks that reflect prior knowledge of the tissue and a histological image. However, unlike other image domains, the complex structure of the tissue prevents a simple creation of histology semantic masks that are required as input to the image translation model, while semantic masks extracted from real images reduce the process's scalability. In this work, we introduce a scalable generative model, coined as DEPAS (De-novo Pathology Semantic Masks), that captures tissue structure and generates high-resolution semantic masks with state-of-the-art quality. We demonstrate the ability of DEPAS to generate realistic semantic maps of tissue for three types of organs: skin, prostate, and lung. Moreover, we show that these masks can be processed using a generative image translation model to produce photorealistic histology images of two types of cancer with two different types of staining techniques. Finally, we harness DEPAS to generate multi-label semantic masks that capture different cell types distributions and use them to produce histological images with on-demand cellular features. Overall, our work provides a state-of-the-art solution for the challenging task of generating synthetic histological images while controlling their semantic information in a scalable way.",

For early-stage chronic disease diagnosis, it is challenging to automate the detection of CMBs and increase the reliability of prediction outputs. This study developed a system for identifying microbleeds in MRI images and gene expression data and determining the severity of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Initially, a spike neural network (SNN) and decision tree were utilised to identify microbleeds in AD from MRI images and gene expression respectively. However, the conclusions of these two methods cannot be interpreted due to the complexity of their internal processing steps. This study proposed two explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods for interpreting prediction outputs in an effort to boost reliability. Pixel density analysis (PDA) and probabilistic graphical model (PGM) explain the decision-making processes for MRI images and gene expression data for the diagnosis of microbleeds and the severity analysis of AD.",

Automatic cough counting tools must provide accurate information, while running on a lightweight, portable device that protects the patient's privacy. Several devices and algorithms have been developed for cough counting, but many use only error-prone audio signals, rely on offline processing that compromises data privacy, or utilize processing and memory-intensive neural networks that require more hardware resources than can fit on a wearable device. Therefore, there is a need for wearable devices that employ multimodal sensors to perform accurate, privacy-preserving, automatic cough counting algorithms directly on the device in an edge Artificial Intelligence (edge-AI) fashion. To advance this research field, we contribute the first publicly accessible cough counting dataset of multimodal biosignals. The database contains nearly 4 hours of biosignal data, with both acoustic and kinematic modalities, covering 4,300 annotated cough events from 15 subjects. Furthermore, a variety of non-cough sounds and motion scenarios mimicking daily life activities are also present, which the research community can use to accelerate machine learning (ML) algorithm development. A technical validation of the dataset reveals that it represents a wide variety of signal-to-noise ratios, which can be expected in a real-life use case, as well as consistency across experimental trials. Finally, to demonstrate the usability of the dataset, we train a simple cough vs non-cough signal classifier that obtains a 91% sensitivity, 92% specificity, and 80% precision on unseen test subject data. Such edge-friendly AI algorithms have the potential to provide continuous ambulatory monitoring of the numerous chronic cough patients.",

To achieve a more comprehensive assessment, data-driven techniques, specifically independent component analysis (ICA), can be employed to generate outcome variables that describe unique but complementary aspects of functional connectivity within and between networks. In this study, resting-state fMRI and behavioral data were collected from 50 healthy participants in the Human Connectome Project. The neuropsychological battery evaluated performance in various domains, including episodic memory, fluid intelligence, attention, working memory, executive function, cognitive flexibility, inhibition, and processing speed. Emotional measures were also included to assess emotion recognition and negative affects (sadness, fear, and anger). A multivariate approach was adopted to evaluate the association between cognitive abilities and emotional correlates on spatiotemporal features of intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs). The results were explored at a false discovery rate-corrected threshold of p < 0.05. There was a significant positive association between within-network connectivity of the left central executive network (CEN) and inhibitory control and attention, and a significant negative association between within-network connectivity of the right CEN and episodic memory. Furthermore, increased within-network connectivity of the default-mode network (DMN) was linked to higher fluid intelligence, while within-network connectivity in the salience network (SN) and dorsal attention network (DAN) was associated with cognitive flexibility. Anger was found to be significantly related to increased functional network connectivity between SN and CEN. Sadness and fear were associated with increased within-network connectivity of the right CEN. Additionally, fear was associated with low-frequency spectral power in SN and DMN. These findings offer new insights into the intricate relation between ICN features and cognitive and emotional functions.",

This study is the first to evaluate which, among these multiple frailty-related indicators, are important and differential predictors of clinical cohorts that represent progression along an Alzheimer's disease (AD) spectrum. We applied machine-learning technology to such indicators in order to identify the leading predictors of three AD spectrum cohorts; viz., subjective cognitive impairment (SCI), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD. The common benchmark was a cohort of cognitively unimpaired (CU) older adults. METHODS: The four cohorts were from the cross-sectional Comprehensive Assessment of Neurodegeneration and Dementia dataset. We used random forest analysis (Python 3.7) to simultaneously test the relative importance of 83 multi-modal frailty indicators in discriminating the cohorts. We performed an explainable artificial intelligence method (Tree Shapley Additive exPlanation values) for deep interpretation of prediction effects. RESULTS: We observed strong concurrent prediction results, with clusters varying across cohorts. The SCI model demonstrated excellent prediction accuracy (AUC = 0.89). Three leading predictors were poorer quality of life ([QoL]; memory), abnormal lymphocyte count, and abnormal neutrophil count. The MCI model demonstrated a similarly high AUC (0.88). Five leading predictors were poorer QoL (memory, leisure), male sex, abnormal lymphocyte count, and poorer self-rated eyesight. The AD model demonstrated outstanding prediction accuracy (AUC = 0.98). Ten leading predictors were poorer QoL (memory), reduced olfaction, male sex, increased dependence in activities of daily living (n = 6), and poorer visual contrast. CONCLUSIONS: Both convergent and cohort-specific frailty factors discriminated the AD spectrum cohorts. Convergence was observed as all cohorts were marked by lower quality of life (memory), supporting recent research and clinical attention to subjective experiences of memory aging and their potentially broad ramifications. Diversity was displayed in that, of the 14 leading predictors extracted across models, 11 were selectively sensitive to one cohort. A morbidity intensity trend was indicated by an increasing number and diversity of predictors corresponding to clinical severity, especially in AD. Knowledge of differential deficit predictors across AD clinical cohorts may promote precision interventions.",

We systematically reviewed studies of image-based AI in the diagnosis of fatty liver. METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Library, Pubmed, Embase and assessed the quality of included studies by QUADAS-AI. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, negative likelihood ratio (NLR), positive likelihood ratio (PLR), and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) were calculated using a random effects model. Summary receiver operating characteristic curves (SROC) were generated to identify the diagnostic accuracy of AI models. RESULTS: 15 studies were selected in our meta-analysis. Pooled sensitivity and specificity were 92% (95% CI: 90-93%) and 94% (95% CI: 93-96%), PLR and NLR were 12.67 (95% CI: 7.65-20.98) and 0.09 (95% CI: 0.06-0.13), DOR was 182.36 (95% CI: 94.85-350.61). After subgroup analysis by AI algorithm (conventional machine learning/deep learning), region, reference (US, MRI or pathology), imaging techniques (MRI or US) and transfer learning, the model also demonstrated acceptable diagnostic efficacy. CONCLUSION: AI has satisfactory performance in the diagnosis of fatty liver by medical imaging. The integration of AI into imaging devices may produce effective diagnostic tools, but more high-quality studies are needed for further evaluation.",

These tasks are approached using methods that consider the class taxonomy for predicting a label. The classifiers are gradually becoming increasingly accurate over the complex datasets. While increasing accuracy is a good way to judge a model, in high-risk applications, it needs to be ensured that even if the model makes a mistake, it does not bear a severe consequence. This work explores the concept of severity of an error and extends it to the medical domain. Further, it aims to point out that accuracy or AUROC alone are not sufficient metrics to decide the performance of a model in a setting where a misclassification will incur a severe cost. Various approaches to reduce severity for classification models are compared and evaluated in this work, which indicate that while many of them might be suited for a traditional image classification setting, there is a need for techniques tailored toward tasks and settings of medical domain to push artificial intelligence in healthcare to a deployable state.",

            "chunk": "INTRODUCTION: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are immune-mediated conditions that are increasing in incidence and prevalence worldwide. Their assessment and monitoring are becoming increasingly important, though complex. The best disease control is achieved through tight monitoring of objective inflammatory parameters (such as serum and stool inflammatory markers), cross-sectional imaging and endoscopic assessment. Considering the complexity of the information obtained throughout a patient's journey, artificial intelligence (AI) provides an ideal adjunct to existing tools to help diagnose, monitor and predict the course of disease of patients with IBD. Therefore, we propose a scoping review assessing AI's role in diagnosis, monitoring and prognostication tools in patients with IBD. We aim to detect gaps in the literature and address them in future research endeavours. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will search electronic databases, including Medline, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, CINAHL Complete, Web of Science and IEEE Xplore. Two reviewers will independently screen the abstracts and titles first and then perform the full-text review. A third reviewer will resolve any conflict. We will include both observational studies and clinical trials. Study characteristics will be extracted using a data extraction form. The extracted data will be summarised in a tabular format, following the imaging modality theme and the study outcome assessed. The results will have an accompanying narrative review. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Considering the nature of the project, ethical review by an institutional review board is not required. The data will be presented at academic conferences, and the final product will be published in a peer-reviewed journal.",

Conscience enables nurses to be understanding and careful in patient care. AIM: The study had three aims: (1) to determine the level of conscientious intelligence and palliative care practice of intensive care nurses; (2) to determine the effect of sociodemographic and occupational variables on conscientious intelligence and palliative care practices; and (3) to examine the relationship between conscientious intelligence and palliative care practice. METHODS: This study was designed as a descriptive-correlative study. The sample consisted of 157 nurses from a university hospital. The data were collected using questionnaire form, Conscientious Intelligence Scale and the Palliative Care Self-Reported Practices Scale between February and March 2021. RESULTS: By the general multivariate linear model, while age, educational level, professional experience, total term of employment in the clinic, and training in palliative care were important predictors of palliative care practices, age and gender were significant predictors of conscientious intelligence. It was concluded that the level of palliative care practice of intensive care nurses with a high level of conscientiousness was also higher. CONCLUSION: The conscientious intelligence levels of intensive care nurses positively affected palliative care practices. It can be said that it is important for nurses to combine their conscience with their professional knowledge and skills while providing care services. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: In the realm of nursing, it is imperative for professionals to not only possess knowledge and competence, but also to act with conscience when caring for patients. This study demonstrated that nurses with heightened conscientious awareness are more adept at providing palliative care. Consequently, it is vital to support practices and training that foster conscientiousness among nurses, who must exercise patience and diligence in their careers.",

It is important to understand the experiences of professionals working in healthcare to ensure that future AI tools are acceptable and effectively implemented. The aim of this study was to gain an in-depth understanding of the experiences and perceptions of UK healthcare workers and other key stakeholders about the use of AI in the National Health Service (NHS). DESIGN: A qualitative study using semistructured interviews conducted remotely via MS Teams. Thematic analysis was carried out. SETTING: NHS and UK higher education institutes. PARTICIPANTS: Thirteen participants were recruited, including clinical and non-clinical participants working for the NHS and researchers working to develop AI tools for healthcare settings. RESULTS: Four core themes were identified: positive perceptions of AI; potential barriers to using AI in healthcare; concerns regarding AI use and steps needed to ensure the acceptability of future AI tools. Overall, we found that those working in healthcare were generally open to the use of AI and expected it to have many benefits for patients and facilitate access to care. However, concerns were raised regarding the security of patient data, the potential for misdiagnosis and that AI could increase the burden on already strained healthcare staff. CONCLUSION: This study found that healthcare staff are willing to engage with AI research and incorporate AI tools into care pathways. Going forward, the NHS and AI developers will need to collaborate closely to ensure that future tools are suitable for their intended use and do not negatively impact workloads or patient trust. Future AI studies should continue to incorporate the views of key stakeholders to improve tool acceptability. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT05028179; ISRCTN15113915; IRAS ref: 293515.",

DESIGN: We adopted the system dynamics model incorporating susceptible, exposed, infection and recovery framework to simulate the progress of the pandemic and how the interventions for the COVID-19 response influence the outcomes with a focus on secondary care. SETTING: This study was carried out covering all the local health systems in Southeast of England with a catchment population of six million with a specific focus on Kent and Medway system. PARTICIPANTS: Six local health systems in Southeast of England using Kent and Medway as a case study. INTERVENTIONS: Short to medium 'what if' scenarios incorporating human behaviour, non-pharmaceutical interventions and medical interventions were tested using the model with regular and continuous feedback of the model results to the local health system leaders for monitoring, planning and rapid response as needed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Daily output from the model which included number infected in the population, hospital admissions needing COVID-19 care, occupied general beds, continuous positive airway pressure beds, intensive care beds, hospital discharge pathways and deaths. RESULTS: We successfully implemented a regional series of models based on the local population needs which were used in healthcare planning as part of the pandemic response. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we have demonstrated the utility of system dynamics modelling incorporating local intelligence and collaborative working during the pandemic to respond rapidly and take decisions to protect the population.

            "chunk": "INTRODUCTION: Bladder cancer (BC) is a major health concern that poses a significant threat to the population, with an increasing incidence rate and a high risk of recurrence and progression. The primary clinical method for diagnosing bladder cancer is cystoscopy, but due to the limitations of traditional white light cystoscopy and inadequate clinical experience among junior physicians, its detection rate for bladder tumor, especially small and flat lesions, is relatively low. However, recent years have seen remarkable advancements in the application of artificial intelligence (AI) technology in the field of medicine. This has led to the development of numerous AI algorithms that have been successfully integrated into medical practices, providing valuable assistance to clinicians. The purpose of this study is to develop a cystoscopy algorithm that is real-time, cost-effective, high-performing, and accurate, with the aim of enhancing the detection rate of bladder tumors during cystoscopy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For this study, a dataset of 3500 cystoscopic images obtained from 100 patients diagnosed with bladder cancer was collected, and a deep learning model was developed utilizing the U-Net algorithm within a convolutional neural network for training purposes. RESULTS: This study randomly divided 3,500 images from 100 bladder cancer patients into training and validation groups, and each patient's pathology result was confirmed. In the validation group, the accuracy of tumor recognition by the U-Net algorithm reached 98%. Compared to primary urologists, with greater accuracy and faster detection speed. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the potential of U-Net-based deep learning techniques in the detection of bladder tumors. The establishment and optimization of the U-Net model is a significant breakthrough and it provides a valuable reference for future research in the field of medical image processing.",

We then present a few case studies to illustrate the practical utility of XAI, such as identifying carcinogenic molecules and guiding molecular optimizations, in order to provide chemists with concrete examples of ways to take full advantage of XAI-augmented machine learning for chemistry. Despite the initial success of XAI in chemistry, we still face the challenges of developing more reliable explanations, assuring robustness against adversarial actions, and customizing the explanation for different applications and needs of the diverse scientific community. Finally, we discuss the emerging role of large language models like GPT in generating natural language explanations and discusses the specific challenges associated with them.

Considering the nature of collective action problems, however, such involvement could paradoxically and unintentionally suppress existing beneficial social norms in humans, such as those involving cooperation. Here, we test theoretical predictions about such an effect using a unique cyber-physical lab experiment where online participants (N = 300 in 150 dyads) drive robotic vehicles remotely in a coordination game. We show that autobraking assistance increases human altruism, such as giving way to others, and that communication helps people to make mutual concessions. On the other hand, autosteering assistance completely inhibits the emergence of reciprocity between people in favor of self-interest maximization. The negative social repercussions persist even after the assistance system is deactivated. Furthermore, adding communication capabilities does not relieve this inhibition of reciprocity because people rarely communicate in the presence of autosteering assistance. Our findings suggest that active safety assistance (a form of simple AI support) can alter the dynamics of social coordination between people, including by affecting the trade-off between individual safety and social reciprocity. The difference between autobraking and autosteering assistance appears to relate to whether the assistive technology supports or replaces human agency in social coordination dilemmas. Humans have developed norms of reciprocity to address collective challenges, but such tacit understandings could break down in situations where machine intelligence is involved in human decision-making without having any normative commitments.",

            "chunk-id": 1,
            "chunk": "BACKGROUND: Varenicline is a pharmacological intervention for tobacco dependence that is safe and effective in facilitating smoking cessation. Enhanced adherence to varenicline augments the probability of prolonged smoking abstinence. However, research has shown that one-third of people who use varenicline are nonadherent by the second week. There is evidence showing that behavioral support helps with medication adherence. We have designed an artificial intelligence (AI) conversational agent or health bot, called \"ChatV,\" based on evidence of what works as well as what varenicline is, that can provide these supports. ChatV is an evidence-based, patient- and health care provider-informed health bot to improve adherence to varenicline. ChatV has been programmed to provide medication reminders, answer questions about varenicline and smoking cessation, and track medication intake and the number of cigarettes. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore the feasibility of the ChatV health bot, to examine if it is used as intended, and to determine the appropriateness of proceeding with a randomized controlled trial. METHODS: We will conduct a mixed methods feasibility study where we will pilot-test ChatV with 40 participants. Participants will be provided with a standard 12-week varenicline regimen and access to ChatV. Passive data collection will include adoption measures (how often participants use the chatbot, what features they used, when did they use it, etc). In addition, participants will complete questionnaires (at 1, 4, 8, and 12 weeks) assessing self-reported smoking status and varenicline adherence, as well as questions regarding the acceptability, appropriateness, and usability of the chatbot, and participate in an interview assessing acceptability, appropriateness, fidelity, and adoption. We will use \"stop, amend, and go\" progression criteria for pilot studies to decide if a randomized controlled trial is a reasonable next step and what modifications are required. A health equity lens will be adopted during participant recruitment and data analysis to understand and address the differences in uptake and use of this digital health solution among diverse sociodemographic groups. The taxonomy of implementation outcomes will be used to assess feasibility, that is, acceptability, appropriateness, fidelity, adoption, and usability. In addition, medication adherence and smoking cessation will be measured to assess the preliminary treatment effect. Interview data will be analyzed using the framework analysis method. RESULTS: Participant enrollment for the study will begin in January 2024. CONCLUSIONS: By using predetermined progression criteria, the results of this preliminary study will inform the determination of whether to advance toward a larger randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness of the health bot. Additionally, this study will explore the acceptability, appropriateness, fidelity, adoption, and usability of the health bot. These insights will be instrumental in refining the intervention and the health bot. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05997901; https://classic.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05997901.

The interfering role of happiness in this equation is unneglectable; however, this association has not been established in clinical medical students exposed to work pressures and stressful hospital atmospheric. The present perusal was conducted to evaluate the relationship between EI and happiness in clinical medical students. METHODS: A multicenter cross-sectional investigation was conducted in Iran from December 2021 to June 2022. Multi-stage cluster sampling followed by a systematic random selection was applied to choose participants. Data gathering was carried out online by Brief Emotional Intelligence Scale-10 and Oxford Happiness Questionnaire. RESULTS: Data from 405 participants were analyzed. The mean age was 24.2 years; men and women constituted 208 (51.4%) and 197 (48.6%) of all participants. Gamma regression analysis has determined age (Exp (B) = 1.016, p-value < 0.001), female gender (Exp (B) = 0.966, p-value = 0.04), extrovert personality (Exp (B) = 1.076, p-value < 0.001), perceived somatic health (Exp (B) = 1.002, p-value < 0.001), and stress level (Exp (B) = 0.990, p-value = 0.01) as predictors of happiness. EI comprises five domains, and except for appraisal of others' emotions, an increase in all other domains of emotional intelligence was associated with higher happiness. GBRT model of significant variables revealed regulation of own emotions is the most happiness-predictor variable (Exp (B) = 1.042, p-value < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Diminishing the stresses helps medical students have a happier life. In happiness-boosting strategies, vulnerable individuals (women, introverts, and those of higher age) ought to be noted as the targeted population. In this investigation, emotional intelligence was the most effective predictor of happiness in clinical medical students. Planning to promote happiness in these medical staff by enhancing their EI leads to better decision-making and more prosperity in their job, resulting in better patient care services.",

This study aims to evaluate how the factors of personality, emotional intelligence, burnout and the psychosocial climate derived from the work environment of teachers influence their levels of psychological well-being, to verify whether these variables allow us to establish a predictive model of psychological well-being by means of multiple regression analysis. METHODS: Participants were a group of 386 teachers in early childhood, Primary and Secondary education, both in training and in active service (71.5% women; 28.5% men). A correlation and multiple regression analysis were performed to establish a predictive model of psychological well-being. We used 5 instruments: Psychosocial Climate at Work Scales (ECPT); verall Personality Assessment Scale (OPERAS); Questionnaire for Evaluation of Burnout Syndrome at Work (CESQT); Spanish adaptation of the Riff Psychological Well-being Scales (EBP) and Spanish validation of the Trait Meta-Mood Scale (TMMS-24). RESULTS: Most of the relationships were significant, and the multiple regression analysis explains 58.5% of the global variance of psychological well-being in teachers, being emotional stability the most relevant and main predictor of psychological well-being, explaining its 38.1%. DISCUSSION: Personality shows a great influence in psychological well-being of teachers, particularly emotional stability.

Many educators, faced with the burden of commenting on substantial student essays, have introduced automated writing evaluation (AWE) into second language (L2) writing considering its affordance of immediate scores and diagnostic information. However, students' processing strategies and perceptions of such computer-generated feedback and its impact on student writing quality, particularly as mediated by language proficiency, remain under-explored. This study examines the impact of Pigai, a Chinese AWE system, on revision processes and writing products of 42 English as a foreign language (EFL) learners with varying language levels by analyzing feedback points, feedback uptake, text quality in complexity, accuracy, and fluency (CAF), and perceptions. The findings are as follows. When confronted with AWE instruction, the majority of student work focuses on correcting errors, but higher-level students exhibit an emphasis on language improvement beyond the surface level compared to lower-level students. According to CAF measures, automated feedback exerts greater effects on accuracy for unskilled learners and lexical complexity for skilled learners in the development of interlanguage. Learner profiles and perceptions of students at different levels are explored along four dimensions: writing quality, cognitive engagement, behavioral engagement, and affective engagement. Finally, the potential issues of such technology-based writing instruction are pointed out.",

This paper aims to investigate the psychophysiological effects of the media in Chinese contexts when different agents (AI or human) broadcast different types (emotional/neutral) of news. Comparing the electrophysiological data of the participants' EEG while listening to different newscast agents revealed that brain activity responses were greater when listening to a human newscast than to an AI voice newscast. And beta bands in left posterior temporal lobe were significantly different, suggesting that participants' brain were better at processing, comprehending auditory information, and storing working memory when listening to a human reporter than when listening to a voice generated by AI. Moreover, the ERP results and the interaction effect of content valence and agent voice demonstrated that the human voice generated greater cognitive effect, which may reflect participants' trust in the credibility and fluency of the human voice news.

            "chunk": "BACKGROUND: The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in detecting colorectal neoplasia during colonoscopy holds the potential to enhance adenoma detection rates (ADRs) and reduce adenoma miss rates (AMRs). However, varied outcomes have been observed across studies. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the potential advantages and disadvantages of employing AI-aided systems during colonoscopy. METHODS: Using Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms and keywords, a comprehensive electronic literature search was performed of the Embase, Medline, and the Cochrane Library databases from the inception of each database until October 04, 2023, in order to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing AI-assisted with standard colonoscopy for detecting colorectal neoplasia. Primary outcomes included AMR, ADR, and adenomas detected per colonoscopy (APC). Secondary outcomes comprised the poly missed detection rate (PMR), poly detection rate (PDR), and poly detected per colonoscopy (PPC). We utilized random-effects meta-analyses with Hartung-Knapp adjustment to consolidate results. The prediction interval (PI) and I(2) statistics were utilized to quantify between-study heterogeneity. Moreover, meta-regression and subgroup analyses were performed to investigate the potential sources of heterogeneity. This systematic review and meta-analysis is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42023428658). FINDINGS: This study encompassed 33 trials involving 27,404 patients. Those undergoing AI-aided colonoscopy experienced a significant decrease in PMR (RR, 0.475; 95% CI, 0.294-0.768; I(2) = 87.49%) and AMR (RR, 0.495; 95% CI, 0.390-0.627; I(2) = 48.76%). Additionally, a significant increase in PDR (RR, 1.238; 95% CI, 1.158-1.323; I(2) = 81.67%) and ADR (RR, 1.242; 95% CI, 1.159-1.332; I(2) = 78.87%), along with a significant increase in the rates of PPC (IRR, 1.388; 95% CI, 1.270-1.517; I(2) = 91.99%) and APC (IRR, 1.390; 95% CI, 1.277-1.513; I(2) = 86.24%), was observed. This resulted in 0.271 more PPCs (95% CI, 0.144-0.259; I(2) = 65.61%) and 0.202 more APCs (95% CI, 0.144-0.259; I(2) = 68.15%). INTERPRETATION: AI-aided colonoscopy significantly enhanced the detection of colorectal neoplasia detection, likely by reducing the miss rate. However, future studies should focus on evaluating the cost-effectiveness and long-term benefits of AI-aided colonoscopy in reducing cancer incidence.

            "chunk": "INTRODUCTION: Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) use is now universal among nonexperts. Artificial intelligence (AI) is currently employed by nonexperts in various imaging modalities to assist in diagnosis and decision making. AIM: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of POCUS, operated by medical students with the assistance of an AI-based tool for assessing the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of patients admitted to a cardiology department. METHODS: Eight students underwent a 6-hour didactic and hands-on training session. Participants used a hand-held ultrasound device (HUD) equipped with an AI-based tool for the automatic evaluation of LVEF. The clips were assessed for LVEF by three methods: visually by the students, by students + the AI-based tool, and by the cardiologists. All LVEF measurements were compared to formal echocardiography completed within 24 hours and were evaluated for LVEF using the Simpson method and eyeballing assessment by expert echocardiographers. RESULTS: The study included 88 patients (aged 58.3 +/- 16.3 years). The AI-based tool measurement was unsuccessful in 6 cases. Comparing LVEF reported by students' visual evaluation and students + AI vs. cardiologists revealed a correlation of 0.51 and 0.83, respectively. Comparing these three evaluation methods with the echocardiographers revealed a moderate/substantial agreement for the students + AI and cardiologists but only a fair agreement for the students' visual evaluation. CONCLUSION: Medical students' utilization of an AI-based tool with a HUD for LVEF assessment achieved a level of accuracy similar to that of cardiologists. Furthermore, the use of AI by the students achieved moderate to substantial inter-rater reliability with expert echocardiographers' evaluation.",

            "chunk": "Dermatological conditions impact many people globally, including those with melanin-rich skin. However, insufficient medical education contributes to delayed diagnoses, misdiagnoses, and inadequate treatment for these conditions. This literature review aims to identify and address gaps in dermatological education for melanin skin. Current research reveals that medical school curricula inadequately cover these conditions, leading to low confidence among students in diagnosing and treating them. This educational deficiency results in healthcare disparities, as melanin skin patients experience inferior outcomes. Misdiagnosis and delayed diagnosis are common due to the lack of training, particularly for conditions like keloids, vitiligo, and lupus erythematosus, which require a specialized understanding of melanin-rich skin. These errors can lead to suboptimal treatment, increased healthcare costs, and negative health outcomes. Additionally, limited representation of melanin skin in clinical studies hampers understanding and treatment options. To address these issues, it is recommended to enhance dermatological education on melanin skin in medical schools, utilize culturally responsive teaching methods, allocate research funds for melanin skin investigations, incorporate telemedicine and artificial intelligence, develop melanin-specific guidelines, and increase diversity in the healthcare workforce. Addressing these educational deficits is crucial for diverse and equitable dermatological care, improved healthcare outcomes, and reduced disparities for individuals with melanin-rich skin.",

            "chunk": "BACKGROUND: The academic performance of medical students may affect their competence in future career prospects. Developing students' subjective well-being to improve academic performance is complex and has been investigated for many years. This cross-sectional study assessed the relationship between academic performance, general intelligence, and medical students' positive well-being. METHODS: This cross-sectional, internet-based survey included male and female medical students from pre-clinical and clinical years at one of the largest public-sector universities in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, between February 2020 and April 2020. The questionnaire included the World Health Organization-Five (WHO-5) Well-being Index, the Draw-A-Person Intellectual Ability (DAP: IQ) Test, and the Academic Success Inventory for College Students (ASICS). Academic performance was represented by a self-reported high-grade point average (GPA). Logistic regression was used to assess the association between academic performance and each of the well-being scores, intelligence, and academic success factors. Statistical significance was established at a p-value less than 0.05. RESULTS: Responses were received from 176 medical students. Most participants were males (93.8%). There was a significant association between GPA above 4.5 and the total WHO-5 well-being score (p = 0.013), the ASICS general skills (p = 0.007), perceiving instructor efficacy (p = 0.005), confidence (p < 0.001), personal adjustment (p = 0.023), and lack of anxiety (p = 0.006). No association was found between GPA and intelligence quotient (IQ) or well-being when other factors were adjusted. CONCLUSIONS: Good academic performance is associated with subjective well-being and domains of academic success, such as perceived efficacy of the instructor, confidence, and personal adjustment. Implementing student development programs in medical schools can have a positive impact on students' academic performance and skills. Future studies assessing the different student support and development programs and their impact on academic success are needed.",

However, deep learning models are typically black-box models where the reason for predictions is unknown. Consequently, the reliability of the model becomes questionable in many circumstances. Explainable AI (XAI) plays an important role in improving the transparency and interpretability of the model thereby making it more reliable for real-time deployment. To investigate the reliability and truthfulness of DL models, this research develops image classification models using transfer learning mechanism and validates the results using XAI technique. Thus, the contribution of this research is twofold, we employ three pre-trained models VGG16, MobileNetV2 and ResNet50 using multiple transfer learning techniques for a fruit classification task consisting of 131 classes. Next, we inspect the reliability of models, based on these pre-trained networks, by utilizing Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations, the LIME, a popular XAI technique that generates explanations for the predictions. Experimental results reveal that transfer learning provides optimized results of around 98% accuracy. The classification of the models is validated on different instances using LIME and it was observed that each model predictions are interpretable and understandable as they are based on pertinent image features that are relevant to particular classes. We believe that this research gives an insight for determining how an interpretation can be drawn from a complex AI model such that its accountability and trustworthiness can be increased.",

            "chunk": "The location of Low-Altitude Flight Service Station (LAFSS) is a comprehensive decision work, and it is also a multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP) with constraints. As a swarm intelligence search algorithm for solving constrained MOOP, the Immune Algorithm (IA) retains the excellent characteristics of genetic algorithm. Using some characteristic information or knowledge of the problem selectively and purposefully, the degradation phenomenon in the optimization process can be suppressed and the global optimum can be achieved. However, due to the large range involved in the low-altitude transition flight, the geographical characteristics, economic level and service requirements among the candidate stations in the corridor are quite different, and the operational safety and service efficiency are interrelated and conflict with each other. And all objectives cannot be optimal. Therefore, this article proposes a Modified Immune Algorithm (MIA) with two-layer response to solve the constrained multi-objective location mathematical model of LAFSS. The first layer uses the demand track as the cell membrane positioning pattern recognition service response distance to trigger the innate immunity to achieve the basic requirements of security service coverage. In the second layer, the expansion and upgrading of adjacent candidate sites are compared to the pathogen's effector, and the adaptive immunity is directly or indirectly triggered again through the cloning, mutation and reproduction between candidate sites to realize the multi-objective equilibrium of the scheme. Taking 486,000 km(2) of Sichuan Province as an example, MIA for LAFSS is simulated by the MATLAB platform. Based on the Spring open source application framework of Java platform, the cesiumjs map data is called through easyui, and the visualization of site selection scheme is presented with the terrain data of Map World as the background. The experimental results show that, compared with dynamic programming and ordinary immunization, the immune trigger mode of double response and the improved algorithm of operation parameter combination designed by the Taguchi experiment, the total economic cost of location selection is reduced by 26.4%, the service response time is reduced by 25%, the repeat coverage rate is reduced by 29.5% and the effective service area is increased by 17.5%. The security risk, service efficiency and location cost are balanced. The present work is to provide an effective location method for the layout number and location of local transfer flight service stations. For complex scenes with larger scale of low-altitude flight supply and demand and larger terrain changes in the region, the above research methods can be used to effectively split and reduce the dimension.",

Thus, vehicles can sense mobile environments and make rational driving decisions. Therefore, the safety and efficiency of traffic flow would be enhanced. However, due to the unknown nature and higher complexity of the connected network environments of vehicles, the utilization of conventional optimization theory fails to generate satisfying results. To address the problem, this article proposes a methodology for collaborative transmission for communication regarding the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) with the help of advanced computational algorithms. The article employs a multi-intelligence advanced computational algorithm to construct a collaborative communication transmission mechanism in the telematics communication system model. The proposed algorithm fully considers the vehicle mobility and quality-of-service (QoS) of telematics services within the network slice. It adjusts the slice's radio resource allocation and parameter settings on an expanded time scale to improve the QoS of telematics services and increase the system's long-term revenue. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm has a more significant performance improvement than conventional algorithms using telematics information transmission. For example, when the same load conditions are under consideration, the total capacity of the vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) link optimized by the proposed algorithm is still higher than that of the other three baseline strategies.",

These systems either read passages and answer questions given in natural languages or if a question is given, they extract the most accurate answer from documents retrieved from the internet. Arabic is spoken by Arabs and Muslims and is located in the middle of the Arab world, which encompasses the Middle East and North Africa. It is difficult to use natural language processing techniques to process modern Arabic owing to the language's complex morphology, orthographic ambiguity, regional variations in spoken Arabic, and limited linguistic and technological resources. Only a few Arabic QA experiments and systems have been designed on small datasets, some of which are yet to be made available. Although several reviews of Arabic QA studies have been conducted, the number of studies covered has been limited and recent trends have not been included. To the best of our knowledge, only two systematic reviews focused on Arabic QA have been published to date. One covered only 26 primary studies without considering recent techniques, while the other covered only nine studies conducted for Holy Qur'an QA systems. Here, the included studies were analyzed in terms of the datasets used, domains covered, types of Arabic questions asked, information retrieved, the mechanism used to extract answers, and the techniques used. Based on the results of the analysis, several limitations, concerns, and recommendations for future research were identified. Additionally, a novel taxonomy was developed to categorize the techniques used based on the domains and approaches of the QA system.",

Other decision tasks are related to network functions, such as traffic classifications, scheduling, capacity, coverage trade-offs, and policy enforcement. These decisions are often decentralized, and each network node makes its own decisions based on the preconfigured rules or policies. To ensure effectiveness, it is essential that planning and functional decisions are in harmony. However, human intervention-based decisions are subject to high costs, delays, and mistakes. On the other hand, machine learning has been used in different fields of life to automate decision processes intelligently. Similarly, future intelligent networks are also expected to see an intense use of machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques for functional and operational automation. This article investigates the current state-of-the-art methods for packet scheduling and related decision processes. Furthermore, it proposes a machine learning-based approach for packet scheduling for agile and cost-effective networks to address various issues and challenges. The analysis of the experimental results shows that the proposed deep learning-based approach can successfully address the challenges without compromising the network performance. For example, it has been seen that with mean absolute error from 6.38 to 8.41 using the proposed deep learning model, the packet scheduling can maintain 99.95% throughput, 99.97% delay, and 99.94% jitter, which are much better as compared to the statically configured traffic profiles.",

In the past decade of rapid development of deep learning, many artificial intelligence methods or deep learning models have been built to improve prediction accuracy. But data-driven end-to-end deep network models usually require large data sets to support. For tourism forecasting, the sample is insufficient and many models are difficult to apply. In this article, we propose a novel hybrid model GM-LSTM, which combines the advantages of gray models and neural networks to achieve self-adaptive prediction with small samples. Specifically, the overall trend of tourism demand is captured by a first-order gray model and the non-linear residual fluctuation is characterized using a long short-term memory (LSTM) network with a rolling mechanism. The model is validated through a case study of up to 38 years of data on annual international tourist arrivals in Xi'an, China. The proposed GM-LSTM model achieved a predicted MAPE value of 11.88%, outperforming other time series models. The results indicate that our proposed hybrid model is accurate and efficient.",

Clinical data indicates that COVID-19 significantly damages patients' perception, motor function, and cognitive function. However, the electrophysiological mechanism by which the disease affects the patient's nervous system is not yet clear. Our aim is to investigate the abnormal levels of brain activity and changes in brain functional connectivity network in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We compared and analyzed electroencephalography signal sample entropy, energy spectrum, and brain network characteristic parameters in the delta (1-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz), and beta (13-30 Hz) bands of 15 patients with COVID-19 and 15 healthy controls at rest. RESULTS: At rest, energy values of the four frequency bands in the frontal and temporal lobes of COVID-19 patients were significantly reduced. At the same time, the sample entropy value of the delta band in COVID-19 patients was significantly increased, while the value of the beta band was significantly decreased. However, the average value of the directed transfer function of patients did not show any abnormalities under the four frequency bands. Furthermore, node degree in the temporal lobe of patients was significantly increased, while the input degree of the frontal and temporal lobes was significantly decreased, and the output degree of the frontal and occipital lobes was significantly increased. CONCLUSION: The level of brain activity in COVID-19 patients at rest is reduced, and the brain functional network undergoes a rearrangement. These results preliminarily demonstrate that COVID-19 patients exhibit certain brain abnormalities during rest, it is feasible to explore the neurophysiological mechanism of COVID-19's impact on the nervous system by using EEG signals, which can provide a certain technical basis for the subsequent diagnosis and evaluation of COVID-19 using artificial intelligence and the prevention of brain nervous system diseases after COVID-19 infection.",

We train this detector with a combination of annotated datasets of marine debris and evaluate it on specifically selected test sites where it is highly probable that plastic pollution is present in the detected marine debris. We integrate data-centric artificial intelligence principles by devising a training strategy with extensive sampling of negative examples and an automated label refinement of coarse hand labels.

These cellular complexes often contain unidentified proteins, related to different cellular states or processes. Identifying proteins at resolutions lower than 4 A remains challenging because the side chains cannot be visualized reliably. Here, we present DomainFit, a program for automated domain-level protein identification from cryo-EM maps at resolutions lower than 4 A. By fitting domains from artificial intelligence-predicted models such as AlphaFold2-predicted models into cryo-EM maps, the program performs statistical analyses and attempts to identify the proteins forming the density. Using DomainFit, we identified two microtubule inner proteins, one of them, a CCDC81 domain-containing protein, is exclusively localized in the proximal region of the doublet microtubule from the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila.

            "chunk": "Rare copy number variants (CNVs) and polygenic risk for intelligence (PRS-IQ) both confer risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) but have opposing effects on cognitive ability. The field has struggled to disentangle the effects of these two classes of genomic variants on cognitive ability from their effects on ASD risk, in part because previous studies did not include controls with cognitive measures. We aim to investigate the impact of these genomic variants on ASD risk while adjusting for their known effects on cognitive ability. In a cohort of 8,426 subjects with ASD and 169,804 controls with cognitive assessments, we found that rare coding CNVs and PRS-IQ increased ASD risk, even after adjusting for their effects on cognitive ability. Bottom decile PRS-IQ and CNVs both decreased cognitive ability but had opposing effects on ASD risk. Models combining both classes of variants showed that the effects of rare CNVs and PRS-IQ on ASD risk and cognitive ability were largely additive, further suggesting that risk for ASD is conferred independently from its effects on cognitive ability. Despite imparting mostly additive effects on ASD risk, rare CNVs and PRS-IQ showed opposing effects on core and associated features and developmental history among subjects with ASD. Our findings suggest that cognitive ability itself may not be the factor driving the underlying risk for ASD conferred by these two classes of genomic variants. In other words, ASD risk and cognitive ability may be two distinct manifestations of CNVs and PRS-IQ. This study also highlights the challenge of understanding how genetic risk for ASD maps onto its dimensional traits.",

            "chunk": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a global health challenge with high mortality rates, largely due to late diagnosis and suboptimal efficacy of current therapies. With the imperative need for more reliable, non-invasive diagnostic tools and novel therapeutic strategies, this study focuses on the discovery and application of novel genetic biomarkers for HCC using explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). Despite advances in HCC research, current biomarkers like Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) exhibit limitations in sensitivity and specificity, necessitating a shift towards more precise and reliable markers. This paper presents an innovative XAI framework to identify and validate key genetic biomarkers for HCC prognosis. Our methodology involved analyzing clinical and gene expression data to identify potential biomarkers with prognostic significance. The study utilized robust AI models validated against extensive gene expression datasets, demonstrating not only the predictive accuracy but also the clinical relevance of the identified biomarkers through explainable metrics. The findings highlight the importance of biomarkers such as TOP3B, SSBP3, and COX7A2L, which were consistently influential across multiple models, suggesting their role in improving the predictive accuracy for HCC prognosis beyond AFP. Notably, the study also emphasizes the relevance of these biomarkers to the Hispanic population, aligning with the larger goal of demographic-specific research. The application of XAI in biomarker discovery represents a significant advancement in HCC research, offering a more nuanced understanding of the disease and laying the groundwork for improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.",

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine if AI-enhanced ECG (AI-ECG) can track longitudinal therapeutic response and changes in cardiac structure, function, or hemodynamics in obstructive HCM during mavacamten treatment. METHODS: We applied 2 independently developed AI-ECG algorithms (University of California-San Francisco and Mayo Clinic) to serial ECGs (n = 216) from the phase 2 PIONEER-OLE trial of mavacamten for symptomatic obstructive HCM (n = 13 patients, mean age 57.8 years, 69.2% male). Control ECGs from 2,600 age- and sex-matched individuals without HCM were obtained. AI-ECG output was correlated longitudinally to echocardiographic and laboratory metrics of mavacamten treatment response. RESULTS: In the validation cohorts, both algorithms exhibited similar performance for HCM diagnosis, and exhibited mean HCM score decreases during mavacamten treatment: patient-level score reduction ranged from approximately 0.80 to 0.45 for Mayo and 0.70 to 0.35 for USCF algorithms; 11 of 13 patients demonstrated absolute score reduction from start to end of follow-up for both algorithms. HCM scores were significantly associated with other HCM-relevant parameters, including left ventricular outflow tract gradient at rest, postexercise, and with Valsalva, and NT-proBNP level, independent of age and sex (all P < 0.01). For both algorithms, the strongest longitudinal correlation was between AI-ECG HCM score and left ventricular outflow tract gradient postexercise (slope estimate: University of California-San Francisco 0.70 [95% CI: 0.45-0.96], P < 0.0001; Mayo 0.40 [95% CI: 0.11-0.68], P = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: AI-ECG analysis longitudinally correlated with changes in echocardiographic and laboratory markers during mavacamten treatment in obstructive HCM.

Learning on multimodal datasets presents fundamental challenges because the inductive biases can vary by data modality and graphs might not be explicitly given in the input. To address these challenges, multimodal graph AI methods combine different modalities while leveraging cross-modal dependencies using graphs. Diverse datasets are combined using graphs and fed into sophisticated multimodal architectures, specified as image-intensive, knowledge-grounded and language-intensive models.

Inpatient falls may cause bruises or contusions and even a fractures or head injuries, which can lead to significant physical and economic burdens for patients and their families. Therefore, it is important to predict the risks involved surrounding hospitalized patients falling in order to better provide medical personnel with effective fall prevention measures. SETTING: This study retrospectively used EHR data taken from the Taichung Veterans General Hospital clinical database between January 2015 and December 2019. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 53,122 patient records were collected in this study, of which 1,157 involved fall patients and 51,965 were non-fall patients. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURE: This study integrated the characteristics and clinical data of patients with falls and without falls using RapidMiner Studio as an analysis tool for various models of artificial intelligence. Utilization of 8 differ models to identify the most important factors surrounding inpatient fall risk. This study used the sensitivity, specificity, and area under the ROC curve to compute the data by 5-fold cross-validation and then compared them by pairwise t-tests. RESULTS: The predictive classifier was developed based upon the gradient boosted trees (XGBoost) model which outperformed the other seven baseline models and achieved a cross-validated ACC of 95.11%, AUC of 0.990, F1 score of 95.1%. These results show that the XGBoost model was used when dealing with multisource patient data, which in this case delivered a highly predictive performance on the risk of inpatient falls. CONCLUSION: Machine learning methods identify the most important factors regarding the detection of inpatients who are at risk of falling, which in turn would improve the quality of patient care and reduce the workloads of the nursing staff when making fall assessments.",

With a prevalence of up to 40% of patients with diabetes, DR constitutes a significant public health burden on the country. Saudi Arabia has not yet established a national screening program for DR. Mounting evidence shows that Artificial intelligence (AI)-based DR screening programs are slowly becoming superior to traditional screening, with the COVID-19 pandemic accelerating research into this topic as well as changing the outlook of the public toward it. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the perception and acceptance of AI in DR screening among eye care professionals in Saudi Arabia. METHODS: A cross-sectional study using a self-administered online-based questionnaire was distributed by email through the registry of the Saudi Commission For Health Specialties (SCFHS). 309 ophthalmologists and physicians involved in diabetic eye care in Saudi Arabia participated in the study. Data analysis was done by SPSS, and a value of p < 0.05 was considered significant for statistical purposes. RESULTS: 54% of participants rated their level of AI knowledge as above average and 63% believed that AI and telemedicine are interchangeable. 66% believed that AI would decrease the workforce of physicians. 79% expected clinical efficiency to increase with AI. Around 50% of participants expected AI to be implemented in the next 5 years. DISCUSSION: Most participants reported good knowledge about AI. Physicians with more clinical experience and those who used e-health apps in clinical practice regarded their AI knowledge as higher than their peers. Perceived knowledge was strongly related to acceptance of the benefits of AI-based DR screening. In general, there was a positive attitude toward AI-based DR screening. However, concerns related to the labor market and data confidentiality were evident. There should be further education and awareness about the topic.",

Optical microscopy remains the gold standard technique for malaria diagnosis, however, it requires expertise, is time-consuming and difficult to reproduce. Therefore, new diagnostic techniques based on digital image analysis using artificial intelligence tools can improve diagnosis and help automate it. METHODS: In this study, a dataset of 2571 labeled thick blood smear images were created. YOLOv5x, Faster R-CNN, SSD, and RetinaNet object detection neural networks were trained on the same dataset to evaluate their performance in Plasmodium parasite detection. Attention modules were applied and compared with YOLOv5x results. To automate the entire diagnostic process, a prototype of 3D-printed pieces was designed for the robotization of conventional optical microscopy, capable of auto-focusing the sample and tracking the entire slide. RESULTS: Comparative analysis yielded a performance for YOLOv5x on a test set of 92.10% precision, 93.50% recall, 92.79% F-score, and 94.40% mAP0.5 for leukocyte, early and mature Plasmodium trophozoites overall detection. F-score values of each category were 99.0% for leukocytes, 88.6% for early trophozoites and 87.3% for mature trophozoites detection. Attention modules performance show non-significant statistical differences when compared to YOLOv5x original trained model. The predictive models were integrated into a smartphone-computer application for the purpose of image-based diagnostics in the laboratory. The system can perform a fully automated diagnosis by the auto-focus and X-Y movements of the robotized microscope, the CNN models trained for digital image analysis, and the smartphone device. The new prototype would determine whether a Giemsa-stained thick blood smear sample is positive/negative for Plasmodium infection and its parasite levels. The whole system was integrated into the iMAGING smartphone application. CONCLUSION: The coalescence of the fully-automated system via auto-focus and slide movements and the autonomous detection of Plasmodium parasites in digital images with a smartphone software and AI algorithms confers the prototype the optimal features to join the global effort against malaria, neglected tropical diseases and other infectious diseases.",

            "chunk": "The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that pathogens like Escherichia coli, primarily linked to food and water contamination, are associated with 485,000 deaths from diarrheal diseases annually, translating to a staggering worldwide economic loss of nearly 12 billion USD per annum. International organizations like the WHO and United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) have established related guidelines and criteria for pathogenic detection technologies and driving the search for innovative and efficient detection methods. This comprehensive review examines the trajectory of waterborne pathogenic bacteria detection technologies from traditional techniques, i.e., culture-based methods, to current detection methods including various forms of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques [qualitative real-time PCR, digital PCR, ELISA, loop-mediated isothermal amplification, next-generation sequencing (NGS)] and to emerging techniques, i.e., biosensors and artificial intelligence (AI). The scope of the review paper focuses on waterborne pathogenic bacteria that are recognized as human pathogens, posing tangible threats to public health through waterborne. The detection techniques' merits, constraints, research gaps and future perspectives are critically discussed. Advancements in digital droplet PCR, NGS and biosensors have significantly improved sensitivity and specificity, revolutionizing pathogen detection. Additionally, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with these technologies has enhanced detection accuracy, enabling real-time analysis of large datasets. Molecular-based methods and biosensors show promise for efficient water quality monitoring, especially in resource-constrained settings, but on-site practical implementation remains a challenge. The pairwise comparison metrics used in this review also offer valuable insights into quick evaluation on the advantages, limitations and research gaps of various techniques, focusing on their applicability in field settings and timely analyses. Future research efforts should focus on developing robust, cost-effective and user-friendly techniques for routine waterborne bacteria monitoring, ultimately safeguarding global water supplies and public health, with AI and data analysis playing a crucial role in advancing these methods for a safer environment.",

AIM: To investigate the accuracy of automated measurements of angles of hallux valgus from radiographs for further integration with the preoperative planning process. METHODS: The data comprises 265 consecutive digital anteroposterior weightbearing foot radiographs. 181 radiographs were utilized for training (161) and validating (20) a U-Net neural network to achieve a mean Sorensen-Dice index > 97% on bone segmentation. 84 test radiographs were used for manual (computer assisted) and automated measurements of hallux valgus severity determined by hallux valgus (HVA) and intermetatarsal angles (IMA). The reliability of manual and computer-based measurements was calculated using the interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and standard error of measurement (SEM). Inter- and intraobserver reliability coefficients were also compared. An operative treatment recommendation was then applied to compare results between automated and manual angle measurements. RESULTS: Very high reliability was achieved for HVA and IMA between the manual measurements of three independent clinicians. For HVA, the ICC between manual measurements was 0.96-0.99. For IMA, ICC was 0.78-0.95. Comparing manual against automated computer measurement, the reliability was high as well. For HVA, absolute agreement ICC and consistency ICC were 0.97, and SEM was 0.32. For IMA, absolute agreement ICC was 0.75, consistency ICC was 0.89, and SEM was 0.21. Additionally, a strong correlation (0.80) was observed between our approach and traditional clinical adjudication for preoperative planning of hallux valgus, according to an operative treatment algorithm proposed by EFORT. CONCLUSION: The proposed automated, artificial intelligence assisted determination of hallux valgus angles based on deep learning holds great potential as an accurate and efficient tool, with comparable accuracy to manual measurements by expert clinicians. Our approach can be effectively implemented in clinical practice to determine the angles of hallux valgus from radiographs, classify the deformity severity, streamline preoperative decision-making prior to corrective surgery.",

To this end, four preselected scientific databases were chosen for data extraction to align with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) technique. From the initially collected (n = 4436) articles, a total of 32 articles were analysed, being synthesised from the review inclusion criteria, maintaining strict eligibility and eliminating duplicates. None of the various studies found on this innovative healthcare intervention has given a comprehensive picture of how this could be an effective method of care dedicated to rural Indigenous communities with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Herein, we presented the unique concepts of IoMT-driven wearable biosensors tailored for rural indigenous cardiac patients, their clinical implications, and cardiovascular disease management within the telehealth domain. This work contributes to understanding the adoption of wearable IoMT sensor-driven telehealth model, highlighting the need for real-time data from First Nations patients in rural and remote areas for CVD prevention.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The authors retrospectively retrieved 4542 text reports and images for fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT lymphoma examinations from 2008 to 2018 in the University of Wisconsin-Madison institutional clinical imaging database. Of these total reports, 1664 had Deauville scores that were extracted from the reports and served as training labels. The bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) model and initialized BERT models BioClinicalBERT, RadBERT, and RoBERTa were adapted to the nuclear medicine domain by pretraining using masked language modeling. These domain-adapted models were then compared with the non-domain-adapted versions on the task of five-point Deauville score prediction. The language models were compared against vision models, multimodal vision-language models, and a nuclear medicine physician, with sevenfold Monte Carlo cross-validation. Means and SDs for accuracy are reported, with P values from paired t testing. RESULTS: Domain adaptation improved the performance of all language models (P = .01). For example, BERT improved from 61.3% +/- 2.9 (SD) five-class accuracy to 65.7% +/- 2.2 (P = .01) following domain adaptation. Domain-adapted RoBERTa (named DA RoBERTa) performed best, achieving 77.4% +/- 3.4 five-class accuracy; this model performed similarly to its multimodal counterpart (named Multimodal DA RoBERTa) (77.2% +/- 3.2) and outperformed the best vision-only model (48.1% +/- 3.5, P </= .001). A physician given the task on a subset of the data had a five-class accuracy of 66%.

Inadequate IQ may subject patients to technical repeat views during the examination or return for technical recalls. Artificial intelligence (AI) software can objectively evaluate breast positioning and compression metrics for all images and technologists. This study assessed whether implementation of AI software across the authors' institution improved IQ and reduced rates of technical repeats and recalls (TR). From April 2019 to March 2022, TR was retrospectively evaluated for 40 technologists (198 054 images; Centricity electronic medical record system, GE HealthCare), and AI IQ metrics were available for 42 technologists (211 821 images; Analytics, Volpara Health Technologies). Diagnostic and digital breast tomosynthesis images and implant cases were excluded. Kolmogorov-Smirnov, chi(2), and paired t tests were used to evaluate whether AI IQ metrics and TR rates improved between the initial and most recent 12-month periods following AI software implementation (ie, baseline [April 2019 to March 2020] vs current [April 2021 to March 2022]). Comparing baseline with current periods, TR significantly reduced from 0.77% (788 of 102 953 images) to 0.17% (160 of 95 101 images), respectively (P < .001), and overall mean quality score improved by 6% ([2.42 - 2.28]/2.28; P = .001), demonstrating the potential of AI software to improve IQ and reduce patient TR.

The model is a directed acyclic graph whose nodes represent variables, such as the presence of a disease or an imaging finding. Connections between nodes express causal influences between variables as probability values. Bayesian networks can learn their structure (nodes and connections) and/or conditional probability values from data. Bayesian networks offer several advantages: (a) they can efficiently perform complex inferences, (b) reason from cause to effect or vice versa, (c) assess counterfactual data, (d) integrate observations with canonical (\"textbook\") knowledge, and (e) explain their reasoning. Bayesian networks have been employed in a wide variety of applications in radiology, including diagnosis and treatment planning. Unlike deep learning approaches, Bayesian networks have not been applied to computer vision. However, hybrid artificial intelligence systems have combined deep learning models with Bayesian networks, where the deep learning model identifies findings in medical images and the Bayesian network formulates and explains a diagnosis from those findings. One can apply a Bayesian network's probabilistic knowledge to integrate clinical and imaging findings to support diagnosis, treatment planning, and clinical decision-making.

In addition, unreported iPE is common. This retrospective single-center cross-sectional study evaluated the effect of an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm on the report turnaround time, time to treatment, and detection rate in patients with cancer-associated iPE. Adult patients with cancer were included either before (July 1, 2018, to June 30, 2019) or after (November 1, 2020, to April 30, 2021) implementation of an AI algorithm for iPE detection and triage. The results demonstrated that reported iPE prevalence was significantly higher in the period after AI implementation (2.5% [26 of 1036 studies] vs 0.8% [16 of 1892 studies], P < .001). Both report that the turnaround time (median, 0.66 hour vs 24.68 hours, P < .001) and time to treatment (median, 0.98 hour vs 28.05 hours, P < .001) were significantly shorter after AI implementation. In conclusion, the use of AI for detection and triage of iPE in clinical practice resulted in an increased detection rate of iPE and significantly shorter report turnaround time and time to treatment for patients with cancer-associated iPE.

            "chunk": "BACKGROUND: Infectious keratitis (IK) is a sight-threatening condition requiring immediate definite treatment. The need for prompt treatment heavily depends on timely diagnosis. The diagnosis of IK, however, is challenged by the drawbacks of the current \"gold standard.\" The poorly differentiated clinical features, the possibility of low microbial culture yield, and the duration for culture are the culprits of delayed IK treatment. Deep learning (DL) is a recent artificial intelligence (AI) advancement that has been demonstrated to be highly promising in making automated diagnosis in IK with high accuracy. However, its exact accuracy is not yet elucidated. This article is the first systematic review and meta-analysis that aims to assess the accuracy of available DL models to correctly classify IK based on etiology compared to the current gold standards. METHODS: A systematic search was carried out in PubMed, Google Scholars, Proquest, ScienceDirect, Cochrane and Scopus. The used keywords are: \"Keratitis,\" \"Corneal ulcer,\" \"Corneal diseases,\" \"Corneal lesions,\" \"Artificial intelligence,\" \"Deep learning,\" and \"Machine learning.\" Studies including slit lamp photography of the cornea and validity study on DL performance were considered. The primary outcomes reviewed were the accuracy and classification capability of the AI machine learning/DL algorithm. We analyzed the extracted data with the MetaXL 5.2 Software. RESULTS: A total of eleven articles from 2002 to 2022 were included with a total dataset of 34,070 images. All studies used convolutional neural networks (CNNs), with ResNet and DenseNet models being the most used models across studies. Most AI models outperform the human counterparts with a pooled area under the curve (AUC) of 0.851 and accuracy of 96.6% in differentiating IK vs. non-IK and pooled AUC 0.895 and accuracy of 64.38% for classifying bacterial keratitis (BK) vs. fungal keratitis (FK). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that DL algorithms have high potential in diagnosing and classifying IK with accuracy that, if not better, is comparable to trained corneal experts. However, various factors, such as the unique architecture of DL model, the problem with overfitting, image quality of the datasets, and the complex nature of IK itself, still hamper the universal applicability of DL in daily clinical practice.",

            "chunk": "PURPOSE: The Medical Imaging and Data Resource Center (MIDRC) is a multi-institutional effort to accelerate medical imaging machine intelligence research and create a publicly available image repository/commons as well as a sequestered commons for performance evaluation and benchmarking of algorithms. After de-identification, approximately 80% of the medical images and associated metadata become part of the open commons and 20% are sequestered from the open commons. To ensure that both commons are representative of the population available, we introduced a stratified sampling method to balance the demographic characteristics across the two datasets. APPROACH: Our method uses multi-dimensional stratified sampling where several demographic variables of interest are sequentially used to separate the data into individual strata, each representing a unique combination of variables. Within each resulting stratum, patients are assigned to the open or sequestered commons. This algorithm was used on an example dataset containing 5000 patients using the variables of race, age, sex at birth, ethnicity, COVID-19 status, and image modality and compared resulting demographic distributions to naive random sampling of the dataset over 2000 independent trials. RESULTS: Resulting prevalence of each demographic variable matched the prevalence from the input dataset within one standard deviation. Mann-Whitney U test results supported the hypothesis that sequestration by stratified sampling provided more balanced subsets than naive randomization, except for demographic subcategories with very low prevalence. CONCLUSIONS: The developed multi-dimensional stratified sampling algorithm can partition a large dataset while maintaining balance across several variables, superior to the balance achieved from naive randomization.",

We aimed to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to provide an overall estimate to resolve the given conflicts. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A literature search was conducted in Embase, PubMed, and Scopus through 31 October 2022, to identify studies evaluating artificial intelligence systems using oral and maxillofacial CBCT images for automatic segmentation of anatomical landmarks. The surveys had to report the outcome according to dice coefficient (DICE) or dice similarity coefficient (DSC) index. The estimates were presented as percent and 95% confidence interval (CI). I-squared index was used to assess the heterogeneity between the surveys. RESULTS: A total of 24 eligible studies were finally enrolled. The overall pooled DICE/DSC value for artificial intelligence was 0.92 (95% CI: 0.88-0.95; I-squared=93.6%, p<0.001). Tooth and mandible were evaluated more than other anatomical regions (five studies for each one). The lowest and highest DICE/DSC scores for the artificial intelligence related to inferior alveolar nerve (0.55 [95% CI: 0.47-0.63]) and pharyngeal airway and sinonasal cavity (0.98 [95% CI: 0.98-1.00]). CONCLUSIONS: The findings revealed excellent performance for the artificial intelligence regarding the segmentation task of oral and maxillofacial CBCT images.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly moving from an \"assistant\" into a proper \"colleague\" for literature mining, data analysis and interpretation, and literally having (almost) real scientific conversations. However, being AI based on existing information, if we rely on it excessively will we still be able to question the status quo? In this article, we are particularly interested in discussing the future of proteomics and mass spectrometry with our new electronic collaborator. We leave to the reader the judgement whether the answers we received are satisfactory or superficial. What we were mostly interested in was laying down what we think are critical questions that the proteomics community should occasionally ask to itself. Proteomics has been around for more than 30 years, but it is still missing a few critical steps to fully address its promises as being the new genomics for clinical diagnostics and fundamental science, while becoming a user-friendly tool for every lab. Will we get there with the help of AI? And will these answers change in a short period, as AI continues to advance?",

            "chunk": "Hepatocellular carcinoma causes intrahepatic metastasis via the trans-portal vein. Thus, appropriate mapping of portal segments is necessary for laparoscopic anatomical liver resection. However, because of the difficulty in identifying tactile sensations and the limited surgical view of laparoscopy, augmented reality (AR) has recently been utilized in laparoscopic liver surgery to identify the tumor, vessels, and portal segments. Moreover, artificial intelligence (AI) has been employed to identify landmarks in two-dimensional (2D) images because of concerns regarding the accuracy of superimposing a three-dimensional (3D) model onto a 2D laparoscopic image. In this study, we report an AR-based projection mapping method of portal segments superimposing preoperative 3D models assisted by AI in laparoscopic surgery. The liver silhouette in laparoscopic images should be detected to superimpose 3D models. Labeled liver silhouettes were obtained from 380 images in surgical videos as learning images to implement AI-based silhouette detection. To implement this technique, we used Detectron2, a PyTorch-based object detection library by Facebook AI Research (Now, Meta AI, Menlo Park, California, United States). In the videos, the liver edges were displayed as green outlines according to AI. Additionally, 3D liver models with segmental mapping were generated using the open-source software 3D Slicer from computed tomography images. For AR display, we utilized the model target function of Vuforia SDK (PTC, Inc., Boston, Massachusetts, United States), an industrial AR library with silhouette-based AR display. Lastly, we merged the AI output video with a 3D model in Unity (Unity Software Inc., San Francisco, California, United States) to establish the projection mapping of the portal segment on 2D surgical images. The accuracy was assessed by measuring the maximum error between the liver edges of laparoscopic images and 3D liver silhouettes in five surgical videos. The maximum error between liver edges and 3D model silhouettes ranged from 4 mm to 22 mm in the AI-based approach and 12 mm to 55 mm in the non-AI-based approach. Meanwhile, the mean error was 14.5 and 31.2 mm in the AI-based and non-AI-based approaches, respectively. Despite camera movement, 3D AR displays were maintained. Thus, our AI-assisted projection mapping of the portal segment could offer a new approach for laparoscopic anatomical liver resection.",

METHODS: A retrospective case review for post-LASIK ectasia for myopia or myopic astigmatism. The evaluated data included preoperative subjective refraction, method of flap creation, and topometric/tomographic parameters from Oculus Pentacam, including subjective curvature pattern, topometric, elevation, and pachymetric indices from the Belin Ambrosio display \"BAD\", and the Pentacam Random Forest Index (PRFI). Moreover, preoperative ectasia detection indices were calculated (including Percentage of Tissue Altered \"PTA\" index, Randleman Ectasia Risk Score System \"ERSS\", and Navarro Index for Corneal Ectasia \"NICE\"). RESULTS: Twenty-four eyes of 15 patients were enrolled. Concerning the risk factors, age was lower than 25 in 19 eyes (79%); flaps were created using a microkeratome in 17 eyes (70.8%); thinnest pachymetry was lower than 510mum in eight eyes (33%); total deviation from BAD was higher than 1.6 in 50%; Ambrosio's relational thickness (ART) max was lower than 340 in 45.83%; PTA index was higher than 40% in 16%; ERSS was more than 3 points in 62.5%; NICE was higher than 8 points in three eyes (12.5%); PRFI index was more than 0.125 in 87.5%; two eyes (8%) had no identifiable risk factors. CONCLUSION: Current ectasia risk assessment criteria were insufficient for detecting a relatively large number of cases. There is an unequivocal need for more information, which may be derived from biomechanical assessment and epithelial thickness mapping. Novel corneal tomography indices derived from artificial intelligence may increase accuracy in characterizing ectasia susceptibility.",

At a time of ever-increasing cost for the provision of medicines to citizens, there is a need to restrain the growth of health care costs. The search for computer technologies to stop or slow down the growth of costs acquires a new very important and significant meaning. We discussed the two information technologies in pharmacotherapy and the possibility of combining and sharing them, namely the combination of risk-sharing agreements and Machine Learning, which was made possible by the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Neural networks could be used to predict the outcome to reduce the risk factors for treatment.

            "chunk": "The control of movement in living organisms represents a fundamental task that the brain has evolved to solve. One crucial aspect is how the nervous system organizes the transformation of sensory information into motor commands. These commands lead to muscle activation and subsequent animal movement, which can exhibit complex patterns. One example of such movement is locomotion, which involves the translation of the entire body through space. Central Pattern Generators (CPGs) are neuronal circuits that provide control signals for these movements. Compared to the intricate circuits found in the brain, CPGs can be simplified into networks of neurons that generate rhythmic activation, coordinating muscle movements. Since the 1990s, researchers have developed numerous models of locomotive circuits to simulate different types of animal movement, including walking, flying, and swimming. Initially, the primary goal of these studies was to construct biomimetic robots. However, it became apparent that simplified CPGs alone were not sufficient to replicate the diverse range of adaptive locomotive movements observed in living organisms. Factors such as sensory modulation, higher-level control, and cognitive components related to learning and memory needed to be considered. This necessitated the use of more complex, high-dimensional circuits, as well as novel materials and hardware, in both modeling and robotics. With advancements in high-power computing, artificial intelligence, big data processing, smart materials, and electronics, the possibility of designing a new generation of true bio-mimetic robots has emerged. These robots have the capability to imitate not only simple locomotion but also exhibit adaptive motor behavior and decision-making. This motivation serves as the foundation for the current review, which aims to analyze existing concepts and models of movement control systems. As an illustrative example, we focus on underwater movement and explore the fundamental biological concepts, as well as the mathematical and physical models that underlie locomotion and its various modulations.",

Now that this guideline has been implemented, an accurate description of neurodevelopmental outcome at school age is needed. DESIGN: Population-based cohort study. SETTING: All neonatal intensive care units in the Netherlands. PATIENTS: All infants born between 24(0/7) and 26(6/7) weeks' gestation who were 5.5 years' corrected age (CA) in 2018-2020 were included. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Main outcome measure was neurodevelopmental outcome at 5.5 years. Neurodevelopmental outcome was a composite outcome defined as none, mild or moderate-to-severe impairment (further defined as neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI)), using corrected cognitive score (Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence Scale-III-NL), neurological examination and neurosensory function. Additionally, motor score (Movement Assessment Battery for Children-2-NL) was assessed. All assessments were done as part of the nationwide, standardised follow-up programme. RESULTS: In the 3-year period, a total of 632 infants survived to 5.5 years' CA. Data were available for 484 infants (77%). At 5.5 years' CA, most cognitive and motor (sub)scales were significantly lower compared with the normative mean. Overall, 46% had no impairment, 36% had mild impairment and 18% had NDI. NDI-free survival was 30%, 49% and 67% in live born children at 24, 25 and 26 weeks' gestation, respectively (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: After lowering the threshold for supporting active treatment from 25 to 24 completed weeks' gestation, a considerable proportion of the surviving extremely preterm children did not have any impairment at 5.5 years' CA.",

            "chunk": "BACKGROUND: The number of words children produce (expressive vocabulary) and understand (receptive vocabulary) changes rapidly during early development, partially due to genetic factors. Here, we performed a meta-genome-wide association study of vocabulary acquisition and investigated polygenic overlap with literacy, cognition, developmental phenotypes, and neurodevelopmental conditions, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). METHODS: We studied 37,913 parent-reported vocabulary size measures (English, Dutch, Danish) for 17,298 children of European descent. Meta-analyses were performed for early-phase expressive (infancy, 15-18 months), late-phase expressive (toddlerhood, 24-38 months), and late-phase receptive (toddlerhood, 24-38 months) vocabulary. Subsequently, we estimated single nucleotide polymorphism-based heritability (SNP-h(2)) and genetic correlations (r(g)) and modeled underlying factor structures with multivariate models. RESULTS: Early-life vocabulary size was modestly heritable (SNP-h(2) = 0.08-0.24). Genetic overlap between infant expressive and toddler receptive vocabulary was negligible (r(g) = 0.07), although each measure was moderately related to toddler expressive vocabulary (r(g) = 0.69 and r(g) = 0.67, respectively), suggesting a multifactorial genetic architecture. Both infant and toddler expressive vocabulary were genetically linked to literacy (e.g., spelling: r(g) = 0.58 and r(g) = 0.79, respectively), underlining genetic similarity. However, a genetic association of early-life vocabulary with educational attainment and intelligence emerged only during toddlerhood (e.g., receptive vocabulary and intelligence: r(g) = 0.36). Increased ADHD risk was genetically associated with larger infant expressive vocabulary (r(g) = 0.23). Multivariate genetic models in the ALSPAC (Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children) cohort confirmed this finding for ADHD symptoms (e.g., at age 13; r(g) = 0.54) but showed that the association effect reversed for toddler receptive vocabulary (r(g) = -0.74), highlighting developmental heterogeneity. CONCLUSIONS: The genetic architecture of early-life vocabulary changes during development, shaping polygenic association patterns with later-life ADHD, literacy, and cognition-related traits.",

            "chunk": "INTRODUCTION: Pathologic response (PathR) by histopathologic assessment of resected specimens may be an early clinical end point associated with long-term outcomes with neoadjuvant therapy. Digital pathology may improve the efficiency and precision of PathR assessment. LCMC3 (NCT02927301) evaluated neoadjuvant atezolizumab in patients with resectable NSCLC and reported a 20% major PathR rate. METHODS: We determined PathR in primary tumor resection specimens using guidelines-based visual techniques and developed a convolutional neural network model using the same criteria to digitally measure the percent viable tumor on whole-slide images. Concordance was evaluated between visual determination of percent viable tumor (n = 151) performed by one of the 47 local pathologists and three central pathologists. RESULTS: For concordance among visual determination of percent viable tumor, the interclass correlation coefficient was 0.87 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.84-0.90). Agreement for visually assessed 10% or less viable tumor (major PathR [MPR]) in the primary tumor was 92.1% (Fleiss kappa = 0.83). Digitally assessed percent viable tumor (n = 136) correlated with visual assessment (Pearson r = 0.73; digital/visual slope = 0.28). Digitally assessed MPR predicted visually assessed MPR with outstanding discrimination (area under receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.98) and was associated with longer disease-free survival (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.30; 95% CI: 0.09-0.97, p = 0.033) and overall survival (HR = 0.14, 95% CI: 0.02-1.06, p = 0.027) versus no MPR. Digitally assessed PathR strongly correlated with visual measurements. CONCLUSIONS: Artificial intelligence-powered digital pathology exhibits promise in assisting pathologic assessments in neoadjuvant NSCLC clinical trials. The development of artificial intelligence-powered approaches in clinical settings may aid pathologists in clinical operations, including routine PathR assessments, and subsequently support improved patient care and long-term outcomes.",

Telerehabilitation systems using artificial intelligence can provide reliable solutions and empower patients by providing them with guidance and motivating them to engage in rehabilitation plans and activities. This study aims to understand the patient's and physiotherapist's perspective on the requirements of effective face-to-face physiotherapy sessions to inspire the design of a telerehabilitation platform to be used in home settings. METHODS: The authors used an ethnography-informed approach through observation and semi-structured interviews with patients (n = 13) and physiotherapists (n = 10) in two outpatient rehabilitation clinics. The AEIOU framework was used to structure and analyse the observation. Thematic analysis was used to code and analyse the data collected from the observations and the interviews. RESULTS: Patients' and physiotherapists' perspectives emphasise the need for exercise instruction clarity, evolution monitoring, and feedback. In the absence of the physiotherapist, in home settings, patients feel insecure and fear execution difficulties and limited exercise instructions, while physiotherapists struggle with controlling patients' home exercise performance. Telerehabilitation is seen as an opportunity to move further into home self-rehabilitation programs. CONCLUSIONS: Besides home exercise monitoring and guidance, telerehabilitation platforms must allow personalization and effective communication between patients and physiotherapists.",

            "chunk": "Unisensory cues are often insufficient for animals to effectively engage in foraging, mating, and predatory activities. In contrast, integration of cues collected from multiple sensory organs enhances the overall perceptual experience and thereby facilitates better decision-making. Despite the importance of multisensory integration in animals, the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and neuromorphic computing has primarily focused on processing unisensory information. This lack of emphasis on multisensory integration can be attributed to the absence of a miniaturized hardware platform capable of co-locating multiple sensing modalities and enabling in-sensor and near-sensor processing. In this study, this limitation is addressed by utilizing the chemo-sensing properties of graphene and the photo-sensing capability of monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS(2) ) to create a multisensory platform for visuochemical integration. Additionally, the in-memory-compute capability of MoS(2) memtransistors is leveraged to develop neural circuits that facilitate multisensory decision-making. The visuochemical integration platform is inspired by intricate courtship of Heliconius butterflies, where female species rely on the integration of visual cues (such as wing color) and chemical cues (such as pheromones) generated by the male butterflies for mate selection. The butterfly-inspired visuochemical integration platform has significant implications in both robotics and the advancement of neuromorphic computing, going beyond unisensory intelligence and information processing.",

            "chunk": "Ovarian cancer (OC) is a type of malignant tumor with a consistently high mortality rate. The diagnosis of early-stage OC and identification of functional subsets in the tumor microenvironment are essential to the development of patient management strategies. However, the development of robust models remains unsatisfactory. We aimed to utilize artificial intelligence and single-cell analysis to address this issue. Two independent datasets were screened from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and processed to obtain overlapping differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in stage II-IV vs. stage I diseases. Three explainable machine learning algorithms were integrated to construct models that could determine the tumor stage and extract important characteristic genes as diagnostic biomarkers. Correlations between cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) infiltration and characteristic gene expression were analyzed using TIMER2.0 and their relationship with survival rates was comprehensively explored via the Kaplan-Meier plotter (KM-plotter) online database. The specific expression of characteristic genes in fibroblast subsets was investigated through single-cell analysis. A novel fibroblast subset signature was explored to predict immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) response and oncogene mutation through Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) and artificial neural network algorithms, respectively. We found that Support Vector Machine-Shapley Additive Explanations (SVM-SHAP), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Random Forest (RF) successfully diagnosed early-stage OC (stage I). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) of these models exceeded 0.990. Their overlapping characteristic gene, secreted frizzled-related protein 2 (SFRP2), was a risk factor that affected the overall survival of OC patients with stage II-IV disease (log-rank test: p < 0.01) and was specifically expressed in a fibroblast subset. Finally, the SFRP2(+) fibroblast signature served as a novel predictor in evaluating ICI response and exploring pan-cancer tumor protein P53 (TP53) mutation (AUC = 0.853, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.829-0.877). In conclusion, the models based on SVM-SHAP, XGBoost, and RF enabled the early detection of OC for clinical decision making, and SFRP2(+) fibroblast signature used in diagnostic models can inform OC treatment selection and offer pan-cancer TP53 mutation detection.",

However, advancement of these methods for dietary assessment in research settings has been hindered by the lack of an appropriate dataset against which to benchmark algorithm performance. We conducted the Surveying Nutrient Assessment with Photographs of Meals (SNAPMe) study (ClinicalTrials ID: NCT05008653) to pair meal photographs with traditional food records. Participants were recruited nationally, and 110 enrollment meetings were completed via web-based video conferencing. Participants uploaded and annotated their meal photos using a mobile phone app called Bitesnap and completed food records using the Automated Self-Administered 24-h Dietary Assessment Tool (ASA24((R))) version 2020. Participants included photos before and after eating non-packaged and multi-serving packaged meals, as well as photos of the front and ingredient labels for single-serving packaged foods. The SNAPMe Database (DB) contains 3311 unique food photos linked with 275 ASA24 food records from 95 participants who photographed all foods consumed and recorded food records in parallel for up to 3 study days each. The use of the SNAPMe DB to evaluate ingredient prediction demonstrated that the publicly available algorithms FB Inverse Cooking and Im2Recipe performed poorly, especially for single-ingredient foods and beverages. Correlations between nutrient estimates common to the Bitesnap and ASA24 dietary assessment tools indicated a range in predictive capacity across nutrients (cholesterol, adjusted R(2) = 0.85, p < 0.0001; food folate, adjusted R(2) = 0.21, p < 0.05).

Accurate characterization of plant physiology is, therefore, fundamental to effective plant phenotyping studies; particularly those focused on identifying traits associated with improved yield, lower input requirements, and climate resilience. Here, we outline the approaches used to assess plant physiology and how these techniques of direct empirical observations of processes such as photosynthetic CO(2) assimilation, stomatal conductance, photosystem II electron transport, or the effectiveness of protective energy dissipation mechanisms are unsuited to high-throughput phenotyping applications. Novel optical sensors, remote/proximal sensing (multi- and hyperspectral reflectance, infrared thermography, sun-induced fluorescence), LiDAR, and automated analyses of below-ground development offer the possibility to infer plant physiological status and growth. However, there are limitations to such 'indirect' approaches to gauging plant physiology. These methodologies that are appropriate for the rapid high temporal screening of a number of crop varieties over a wide spatial scale do still require 'calibration' or 'validation' with direct empirical measurement of plant physiological status. The use of deep-learning and artificial intelligence approaches may enable the effective synthesis of large multivariate datasets to more accurately quantify physiological characters rapidly in high numbers of replicate plants. Advances in automated data collection and subsequent data processing represent an opportunity for plant phenotyping efforts to fully integrate fundamental physiological data into vital efforts to ensure food and agro-economic sustainability.",

However, there is a lack of general recommendations for selecting the most appropriate scales, tests, and instruments to objectively evaluate therapy outcomes. Reviews on upper limb and hand measurements reveal that clinicians' choices of tools and methods are highly varied. Some clinicians and medical teams continue to employ non-standard and unverified metrics in their research and measurements. This review article aims to identify the key parameters, assessed by outcome measures and instruments, that play a crucial role in upper limb and hand rehabilitation for post-stroke patients, specifically focusing on the recovery of hand function. The review seeks to assist researchers and medical teams in selecting appropriate outcome measures when evaluating post-stroke patients. We analyze the measured factors and skills found in these outcome measures and highlight useful tools that diversify assessments and enhance result objectivity through graphical representation. The paper also describes trends and new possibilities in hand outcome measures. Clinicians frequently use proven devices, such as EMG, goniometers, and hand dynamometers. Still, there is a growing trend towards incorporating technologies, such as pose and position estimation, using artificial intelligence, or custom hand grip measurement devices. Researchers are increasingly adopting scales previously successful in orthopedic and surgical patients, recognizing their potential for objectivizing outcomes in neurological patients with post-stroke hand complications.

Traditionally, this assessment has been conducted manually by plastic surgeons, ophthalmologists, or trained technicians. However, with the advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) technology, there is a growing interest in the development of automated systems capable of accurately measuring MRD1. In this context, we introduce novel MRD1 measurement methods based on deep learning algorithms that can simultaneously capture images and compute the results. This prospective observational study involved 154 eyes of 77 patients aged over 18 years who visited Chungnam National University Hospital between 1 January 2023 and 29 July 2023. We collected four different MRD1 datasets from patients using three distinct measurement methods, each tailored to the individual patient. The mean MRD1 values, measured through the manual method using a penlight, the deep learning method, ImageJ analysis from RGB eye images, and ImageJ analysis from IR eye images in 56 eyes of 28 patients, were 2.64 +/- 1.04 mm, 2.85 +/- 1.07 mm, 2.78 +/- 1.08 mm, and 3.07 +/- 0.95 mm, respectively. Notably, the strongest agreement was observed between MRD1_deep learning (DL) and MRD1_IR (0.822, p < 0.01). In a Bland-Altman plot, the smallest difference was observed between MRD1_DL and MRD1_IR ImageJ, with a mean difference of 0.0611 and DeltaLOA (limits of agreement) of 2.5162, which was the smallest among all of the groups. In conclusion, this novel MRD1 measurement method, based on an IR camera and deep learning, demonstrates statistical significance and can be readily applied in clinical settings.",

This research endeavors to pioneer a groundbreaking solution utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The objective is to establish a system capable of forecasting instances of intraoperative bleeding during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) and promptly notify the surgeon about bleeding risks. METHODS: To achieve this, a multi-task learning (MTL) CNN was introduced, leveraging a modified version of the U-Net architecture. The aim was to categorize video input as either \"absence of blood accumulation\" (0) or \"presence of blood accumulation\" (1). To facilitate seamless interaction with the neural networks, the Bleeding Artificial Intelligence-based Detector (BLAIR) software was created using the Python Keras API and built upon the PyQT framework. A subsequent clinical assessment of BLAIR's efficacy was performed, comparing its bleeding identification performance against that of a urologist. Various perioperative variables were also gathered. For optimal MTL-CNN training parameterization, a multi-task loss function was adopted to enhance the accuracy of event detection by taking advantage of surgical tools' semantic segmentation. Additionally, the Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) approach was employed to assess software performance. RESULTS: The MTL-CNN demonstrated a remarkable event recognition accuracy of 90.63%. When evaluating BLAIR's predictive ability and its capacity to pre-warn surgeons of potential bleeding incidents, the density plot highlighted a striking similarity between BLAIR and human assessments. In fact, BLAIR exhibited a faster response. Notably, the MCA analysis revealed no discernible distinction between the software and human performance in accurately identifying instances of bleeding. CONCLUSION: The BLAIR software proved its competence by achieving over 90% accuracy in predicting bleeding events during RARP. This accomplishment underscores the potential of AI to assist surgeons during interventions. This study exemplifies the positive impact AI applications can have on surgical procedures.",

            "chunk": "Vascular inflammation is recognized as the primary trigger of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). However, current noninvasive methods are not capable of accurately detecting coronary inflammation. Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) and pericoronary adipose tissue (PCAT), in addition to their role as an energy reserve system, have been found to contribute to the development and progression of coronary artery calcification, inflammation, and plaque vulnerability. They also participate in the vascular response during ischemia, sympathetic stimuli, and arrhythmia. As a result, the evaluation of EAT and PCAT using imaging techniques such as computed tomography (CT), cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), and nuclear imaging has gained significant attention. PCAT-CT attenuation, which measures the average CT attenuation in Hounsfield units (HU) of the adipose tissue, reflects adipocyte differentiation/size and leukocyte infiltration. It is emerging as a marker of tissue inflammation and has shown prognostic value in coronary artery disease (CAD), being associated with plaque development, vulnerability, and rupture. In patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), an inflammatory pericoronary microenvironment promoted by dysfunctional EAT/PCAT has been demonstrated, and more recently, it has been associated with plaque rupture in non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Endothelial dysfunction, known for its detrimental effects on coronary vessels and its association with plaque progression, is bidirectionally linked to PCAT. PCAT modulates the secretory profile of endothelial cells in response to inflammation and also plays a crucial role in regulating vascular tone in the coronary district. Consequently, dysregulated PCAT has been hypothesized to contribute to type 2 myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA) and coronary vasculitis. Recently, quantitative measures of EAT derived from coronary CT angiography (CCTA) have been included in artificial intelligence (AI) models for cardiovascular risk stratification. These models have shown incremental utility in predicting major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) compared to plaque characteristics alone. Therefore, the analysis of PCAT and EAT, particularly through PCAT-CT attenuation, appears to be a safe, valuable, and sufficiently specific noninvasive method for accurately identifying coronary inflammation and subsequent high-risk plaque. These findings are supported by biopsy and in vivo evidence. Although speculative, these pieces of evidence open the door for a fascinating new strategy in cardiovascular risk stratification. The incorporation of PCAT and EAT analysis, mainly through PCAT-CT attenuation, could potentially lead to improved risk stratification and guide early targeted primary prevention and intensive secondary prevention in patients at higher risk of cardiac events.",

            "chunk": "With the recent rise in violent crime, the real-time situation analysis capabilities of the prevalent closed-circuit television have been employed for the deterrence and resolution of criminal activities. Anomaly detection can identify abnormal instances such as violence within the patterns of a specified dataset; however, it faces challenges in that the dataset for abnormal situations is smaller than that for normal situations. Herein, using datasets such as UBI-Fights, RWF-2000, and UCSD Ped1 and Ped2, anomaly detection was approached as a binary classification problem. Frames extracted from each video with annotation were reconstructed into a limited number of images of 3x3, 4x3, 4x4, 5x3 sizes using the method proposed in this paper, forming an input data structure similar to a light field and patch of vision transformer. The model was constructed by applying a convolutional block attention module that included channel and spatial attention modules to a residual neural network with depths of 10, 18, 34, and 50 in the form of a three-dimensional convolution. The proposed model performed better than existing models in detecting abnormal behavior such as violent acts in videos. For instance, with the undersampled UBI-Fights dataset, our network achieved an accuracy of 0.9933, a loss value of 0.0010, an area under the curve of 0.9973, and an equal error rate of 0.0027. These results may contribute significantly to solve real-world issues such as the detection of violent behavior in artificial intelligence systems using computer vision and real-time video monitoring.",

These low-light images will not only affect our observation but will also greatly affect the performance of computer vision processing algorithms. Low-light image enhancement technology can help to improve the quality of images and make them more applicable to fields such as computer vision, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. In this paper, we propose a novel method to enhance images through Bezier curve estimation. We estimate the pixel-level Bezier curve by training a deep neural network (BCE-Net) to adjust the dynamic range of a given image. Based on the good properties of the Bezier curve, in that it is smooth, continuous, and differentiable everywhere, low-light image enhancement through Bezier curve mapping is effective. The advantages of BCE-Net's brevity and zero-reference make it generalizable to other low-light conditions. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.",

To this end, we designed an experiment inspired by pip-and-pop but more appropriate for eliciting attention and P3a-event-related potentials (ERPs). In this study, the aim was to distinguish between targets and distractors based on the subject's electroencephalography (EEG) data. We achieved this objective by employing different machine learning (ML) methods for both individual-subject (IS) and cross-subject (CS) models. Finally, we investigated which EEG channels and time points were used by the model to make its predictions using saliency maps. We were able to successfully perform the aforementioned classification task for both the IS and CS scenarios, reaching classification accuracies up to 76%. In accordance with the literature, the model primarily used the parietal-occipital electrodes between 200 ms and 300 ms after the stimulus to make its prediction. The findings from this research contribute to the development of more effective P300-based brain-computer interfaces. Furthermore, they validate the EEG data collected in our experiment.",

However, with these sensors, AQ monitoring poses a significant challenge, as the data collection and analysis process is complex and prone to errors. Although these sensors do not meet the performance requirements for reference regulatory-equivalent monitoring, they can provide informative measurements and more if we can adjust and add further processing to their raw measurements. Therefore, the integration of these sensors aims to facilitate real-time monitoring and achieve a higher spatial and temporal sampling density, particularly in urban areas, where there is a strong interest in providing AQ surveillance services since there is an increase in respiratory/allergic issues among the population. Leveraging a network of low-cost sensors, supported by 5G communications in combination with Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques (using Convolutional and Deep Neural Networks (CNN and DNN)) to predict 24-h-ahead readings is the goal of this article in order to be able to provide early warnings to the populations of hazards areas. We have evaluated four different neural network architectures: Multi-Linear prediction (with a dense Multi-Linear Neural Network (NN)), Multi-Dense network prediction, Multi-Convolutional network prediction, and Multi-Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network prediction. To perform the training of the prediction of the readings, we have prepared a significant dataset that is analyzed and processed for training and testing, achieving an estimation error for most of the predicted parameters of around 7.2% on average, with the best option being the Multi-LSTM network in the forthcoming 24 h. It is worth mentioning that some pollutants achieved lower estimation errors, such as CO2 with 0.1%, PM10 with 2.4% (as well as PM2.5 and PM1.0), and NO2 with 6.7%.",

In the last decade, machine learning has been successfully implemented to design more accurate and precise medical applications. In this paper, a smart sensing technologies-based architecture is proposed that uses AI and the Internet of Things (IoT) for continuous monitoring and health assistance for diabetes patients. The designed system senses various health parameters, such as blood pressure, blood oxygen, blood glucose (non-invasively), body temperature, and pulse rate, using a wrist band. We also designed a non-invasive blood sugar sensor using a near-infrared (NIR) sensor. The proposed system can predict the patient's health condition, which is evaluated by a set of machine learning algorithms with the support of a fuzzy logic decision-making system. The designed system was validated on a large data set of 50 diabetes patients. The results of the simulation manifest that the random forest classifier gives the highest accuracy in comparison to other machine learning algorithms.

            "chunk": "In the pursuit of enhancing the wine production process through the utilization of new technologies in viticulture, this study presents a novel approach for the rapid assessment of wine grape maturity levels using non-destructive, in situ infrared spectroscopy and artificial intelligence techniques. Building upon our previous work focused on estimating sugar content ( composite functionBrix) from the visible and near-infrared (VNIR) and short-wave infrared (SWIR) regions, this research expands its scope to encompass pH and titratable acidity, critical parameters determining the grape maturity degree, and in turn, wine quality, offering a more representative estimation pathway. Data were collected from four grape varieties-Chardonnay, Malagouzia, Sauvignon Blanc, and Syrah-during the 2023 harvest and pre-harvest phenological stages in the vineyards of Ktima Gerovassiliou, northern Greece. A comprehensive spectral library was developed, covering the VNIR-SWIR spectrum (350-2500 nm), with measurements performed in situ. Ground truth data for pH, titratable acidity, and sugar content were obtained using conventional laboratory methods: total soluble solids (TSS) ( composite functionBrix) by refractometry, titratable acidity by titration (expressed as mg tartaric acid per liter of must) and pH by a pH meter, analyzed at different maturation stages in the must samples. The maturity indicators were predicted from the point hyperspectral data by employing machine learning algorithms, including Partial Least Squares regression (PLS), Random Forest regression (RF), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), in conjunction with various pre-processing techniques. Multi-output models were also considered to simultaneously predict all three indicators to exploit their intercorrelations. A novel multi-input-multi-output CNN model was also proposed, incorporating a multi-head attention mechanism and enabling the identification of the spectral regions it focuses on, and thus having a higher interpretability degree. Our results indicate high accuracy in the estimation of sugar content, pH, and titratable acidity, with the best models yielding mean R2 values of 0.84, 0.76, and 0.79, respectively, across all properties. The multi-output models did not improve the prediction results compared to the best single-output models, and the proposed CNN model was on par with the next best model. The interpretability analysis highlighted that the CNN model focused on spectral regions associated with the presence of sugars (i.e., glucose and fructose) and of the carboxylic acid group. This study underscores the potential of portable spectrometry for real-time, non-destructive assessments of wine grape maturity, thereby providing valuable tools for informed decision making in the wine production industry. By integrating pH and titratable acidity into the analysis, our approach offers a holistic view of grape quality, facilitating more comprehensive and efficient viticultural practices.",

The application of neuroscience tools in the CHSM has received much attention in the construction research community, but comprehensive statistics on the application of neuroscience tools to CHSM is lacking to provide insights for the later scholars. Therefore, this study applied bibliometric analysis to examine the current state of neuroscience tools use in CHSM. The development phases; the most productive journals, regions, and institutions; influential scholars and articles; author collaboration; reference co-citation; and application domains of the tools were identified. It revealed four application domains: monitoring the safety status of construction workers, enhancing the construction hazard recognition ability, reducing work-related musculoskeletal disorders of construction workers, and integrating neuroscience tools with artificial intelligence techniques in enhancing occupational safety and health, where magnetoencephalography (EMG), electroencephalography (EEG), eye-tracking, and electrodermal activity (EDA) are four predominant neuroscience tools. It also shows a growing interest in integrating the neuroscience tools with artificial intelligence techniques to address the safety and health issues. In addition, future studies are suggested to facilitate the applications of these tools in construction workplaces by narrowing the gaps between experimental settings and real situations, enhancing the quality of data collected by neuroscience tools and performance of data processing algorithms, and overcoming user resistance in tools adoption.",

            "chunk": "Disease diagnosis and monitoring using conventional healthcare services is typically expensive and has limited accuracy. Wearable health technology based on flexible electronics has gained tremendous attention in recent years for monitoring patient health owing to attractive features, such as lower medical costs, quick access to patient health data, ability to operate and transmit data in harsh environments, storage at room temperature, non-invasive implementation, mass scaling, etc. This technology provides an opportunity for disease pre-diagnosis and immediate therapy. Wearable sensors have opened a new area of personalized health monitoring by accurately measuring physical states and biochemical signals. Despite the progress to date in the development of wearable sensors, there are still several limitations in the accuracy of the data collected, precise disease diagnosis, and early treatment. This necessitates advances in applied materials and structures and using artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled wearable sensors to extract target signals for accurate clinical decision-making and efficient medical care. In this paper, we review two significant aspects of smart wearable sensors. First, we offer an overview of the most recent progress in improving wearable sensor performance for physical, chemical, and biosensors, focusing on materials, structural configurations, and transduction mechanisms. Next, we review the use of AI technology in combination with wearable technology for big data processing, self-learning, power-efficiency, real-time data acquisition and processing, and personalized health for an intelligent sensing platform. Finally, we present the challenges and future opportunities associated with smart wearable sensors.",

This term that is booming today is known as the Internet of Things. In order to deal with these data close to the source, the term Edge Computing arises. The main objective is to address the limitations of cloud processing and satisfy the growing demand for applications and services that require low latency, greater efficiency and real-time response capabilities. Furthermore, it is essential to underscore the intrinsic connection between artificial intelligence and edge computing within the context of our study. This integral relationship not only addresses the challenges posed by data proliferation but also propels a transformative wave of innovation, shaping a new era of data processing capabilities at the network's edge. Edge devices can perform real-time data analysis and make autonomous decisions without relying on constant connectivity to the cloud. This article aims at analysing and comparing Edge Computing devices when artificial intelligence algorithms are deployed on them. To this end, a detailed experiment involving various edge devices, models and metrics is conducted. In addition, we will observe how artificial intelligence accelerators such as Tensor Processing Unit behave. This analysis seeks to respond to the choice of a device that best suits the necessary AI requirements. As a summary, in general terms, the Jetson Nano provides the best performance when only CPU is used. Nevertheless the utilisation of a TPU drastically enhances the results.",

This poses challenges to the distributed reconfiguration (DR) required for the optimal redeployment of multi-UAVs in the event of vehicle destruction. This paper presents a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning-based DR strategy (DRS) that optimizes the multi-UAV group redeployment in terms of swarm performance. To generate a two-layer DRS between multiple groups and a single group, a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning framework is developed in which a QMIX network determines the swarm redeployment, and each deep Q-network determines the single-group redeployment. The proposed method is simulated using Python and a case study demonstrates its effectiveness as a high-quality DRS for large-scale scenarios.",

Each robot was developed with rendezvous behavior and distributed intelligence to perform obstacle avoidance. The hardware scheme-based obstacle-avoidance algorithm was developed using a bio-inspired flock approach, which was developed with three stages. Initially, the algorithm estimates polygonal obstacles and their orientations. The second stage involves performing avoidance at different orientations of obstacles using a heuristic based Bug2 algorithm. The final stage involves performing a flock rendezvous with distributed approaches and linear movements using a behavioral control mechanism. VLSI architectures were developed for multi-robot obstacle avoidance algorithms and were coded using Verilog HDL. The novel design of this article integrates the multi-robot's obstacle approaches with behavioral control and hardware scheme-based partial reconfiguration (PR) flow. The experiments were validated using FPGA-based multi-robots.",

            "chunk": "In recent years, technological advancements in sensor, communication, and data storage technologies have led to the increasingly widespread use of smart devices in different types of buildings, such as residential homes, offices, and industrial installations. The main benefit of using these devices is the possibility of enhancing different crucial aspects of life within these buildings, including energy efficiency, safety, health, and occupant comfort. In particular, the fast progress in the field of the Internet of Things has yielded exponential growth in the number of connected smart devices and, consequently, increased the volume of data generated and exchanged. However, traditional Cloud-Computing platforms have exhibited limitations in their capacity to handle and process the continuous data exchange, leading to the rise of new computing paradigms, such as Edge Computing and Fog Computing. In this new complex scenario, advanced Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning can play a key role in analyzing the generated data and predicting unexpected or anomalous events, allowing for quickly setting up effective responses against these unexpected events. To the best of our knowledge, current literature lacks Deep-Learning-based approaches specifically devised for guaranteeing safety in IoT-Based Smart Buildings. For this reason, we adopt an unsupervised neural architecture for detecting anomalies, such as faults, fires, theft attempts, and more, in such contexts. In more detail, in our proposal, data from a sensor network are processed by a Sparse U-Net neural model. The proposed approach is lightweight, making it suitable for deployment on the edge nodes of the network, and it does not require a pre-labeled training dataset. Experimental results conducted on a real-world case study demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed solution.",

For this, PD measurements using the bio-inspired antenna were performed on operational 69 kV potential transformers (PT) in a real substation. After the field experiment, laboratory measurements using the IEC 60270 standard method and a bio-inspired antenna were performed, simultaneously, over the evaluated PT. The results obtained at the substation indicated suspicious frequencies of partial discharge activity in two out of three evaluated potential transformers, mainly for the frequencies of 461 MHz, 1366 MHz, 1550 MHz and 1960 MHz. During the laboratory tests, the presence of partial discharge activity over the suspicious potential transformers was confirmed with the detection of PD apparent charge levels above 20 pC. Finally, the frequency spectrum obtained from the PD signals detected by the bio-inspired antenna in the laboratory presented similar frequency values to those obtained during the practical application at the substation, making it a promising indicator for future defect classification studies using artificial intelligence.",
